# **Natural Chakra**

Chakra is everywhere, an intangible force permeating the world. For the most part, ninja (and everyone else) ignore this. It's like knowing that there's oxygen all around: necessarily for life, but not particularly worthy of attention since it's always there.

It does play an important role for shinobi: they naturally respire chakra from the environment, just like they inhale and exhale air, but as chakra is omnipresent, it never matters.

It's called 'natural chakra'. Very rarely, some ninja manage to learn how to access it. The scarcity of this ability has a lot to do with the fact that in most situations, it's impractical: accessing nature chakra requires one to be able to sit calmly and undisturbed for a significant amount of time, something which ninja rarely have the opportunity to do when under pressure.

### **Meditation**

The most basic ability someone seeking to harness natural chakra must master, this is precisely what it sounds like. You sit down, close your eyes, and become perfectly still, clearing your mind.

Obviously, this is easier said than done; a novice will find themselves thinking about not thinking, then their nose will start to itch, they'll get fidgety... and that is where most give up in frustration and go back to studying high-power ninjutsu.

When meditating you cannot talk, or even open your eyes to look around, though you do remain aware of your surroundings to the extent of what you can feel and hear. Indeed, much of meditation is learning how to observe one's surroundings impartially, without reacting. You cannot maintain any Upkeeps greater than 0 while meditating.

In battle, you may declare Meditate as an action. When meditating, you do nothing. Meditate as an action lasts until you declare that you Abort it; you do not need to declare how long you'll be meditating when you begin.

There are two ways to end meditation.

The first is with End Meditation, a Speed 5 action which cannot have its Speed reduced.

The second is your meditation being disrupted. This occurs if you take any action other than End Meditation, if you are hit by any damaging attack, or if you are moved in any way. If this happens, you have a \-5 penalty to Chakra Exhaustion and Stamina, Accuracy, and all d20 rolls, for the next 10 IC.

### **A Tranquil Body** 

As you meditate your body relaxes and is refreshed, weariness ebbing away and pain fading. Every 10 IC you spend meditating, your Stamina penalty is reduced by 1\.

### **A Tranquil Mind**

By emptying your mind, you reach a state of total serenity. Your emotions fade away, letting you assess things calmly and rationally. With that tranquility comes inner balance, disturbances of the mind translating into disturbance of one's chakra, and their absence doing the same. Every 10 IC you spend meditating, your Chakra Exhaustion penalty is reduced by 1\.

### **A Tranquil Soul** 

When your mind and body are in harmony, each completely silent and at ease, your spirit becomes the same. Once you've been meditating for 20 IC, you may sacrifice a point of Willpower to lower your Fatigue level by 1\.

### **Path to Tranquility** 

If you spend at least 100 IC meditating, the first time you fail a Chakra Exhaustion or Stamina roll in the next ten minutes you advance one less Fatigue category; your Stamina and Chakra Exhaustion penalties still reset to 0\. You can only use this once per day.

### **A Dream of the World**

As one sinks into meditation, they become detached from their worldly senses and the accompanying distractions. Only by doing so can they notice the minute variations in the world's own chakra, in all their subtle wonder.

While meditating, you can tell how many people are within X yards, where X is the number of IC you've spent meditating, up to a maximum of your CHA. This does not, however, allow you to tell anything else about them, even their direction or distance.

Except in combat\! In combat, this allows you to find hiding enemies. Every 5 IC you spend meditating while a hidden enemy is within your range, you may make a Chakra Control roll against their Stealth TN, with a \+4 bonus for every 5 IC (total) you've been meditating to a maximum of \+20.

### **One With Nature**

Up until now, you've managed to 'sort of' meditate properly: you're almost sitting still, you're mostly not distracted. Becoming one with nature requires a higher level of discipline.

The phenomenon commonly described as being 'one with nature' is where a person is so still, so unresponsive, that the world's ambient chakra can flow unhindered through their chakra coils, as if they were just another tree or current of wind.

As this takes place, nature chakra builds up within the shinobi's chakra system. While there are dangers associated with it, they don't manifest at this level. Every 1 IC you spend meditating, you get one nature chakra counter (NC). You may have a maximum of up to (RES+CHA)/4 nature chakra counters. Once you end your meditation through the End Meditation action you begin to lose NC at a rate of 1 for every 1 IC. However: If your meditation is broken through any means other than an End Meditation action (or, once you have the ability, activating Sage Mode), you lose all your accumulated nature chakra counters.

### **Natureâ€™s Awakening**

Nature is unyielding; it is powerful, and will crush any who think themselves its better. Nature is adaptable; it changes to meet the needs of its current situation, not because it yields, but because it will always be victorious under any circumstances. Nature is patient; it grows slowly, knowing that there is no need to rush, that the destination is what matters, not the time taken to get there. Nature is gentle; it nourishes, it strengthens, and it protects.

* For every NC you currently have, your damage bonuses are increased by 0.1  
* For every NC you currently have you gain a Damage Reduction (DR) of 1\.  
* For every 10 NC, you have a \+1 bonus to Athletics, Awareness, Chakra Control, and Resistance rolls.  
* For every 15 NC you currently have you gain a negative upkeep which reduces your upkeeps by 1 to a minimum of 0\.  
* For every 30 NC you currently have you gain \+1 bonus to Accuracy and dodge. 

### **A Dream of a Dream**

Every person alters the flow of chakra around them in a unique, distinctive way; some people brighten the world merely by being there, while others darken, and still others are like deep pits from which no light can escape. When you sense someone using A Dream of the World, you can identify their chakra in the future. Having met someone in the past doesn't mean you can immediately identify their chakra.

# **Sage Mode**

The pinnacle of natural chakra. Through diligent discovery or tutelage under a master you have learned to balance the natural energy you take in with the physical and spiritual energies residing in you. This occurs differently depending on the person and is often
