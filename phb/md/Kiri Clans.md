# **Sword Corps**

One of Mist's several special operations units, the Swordsman Corps are trained to be Kirigakure's elite infantry. Militaristic and merciless, only the students who display an abnormal talent or fascination with swordsmanship are selected to be trained by the Corps. Mist's swordsmen may not believe their kenjutsu is superior to ninjutsu or typical taijutsu; some do, while most admit it's simply a very specific focus. Most, however, will very adamantly reject the concept that natural talents or abilities, such as bloodlines, can match their rigorous training. A disproportionate number of the Mizukage's honor guard tend to be members of the Swordsman Corps.

## **Blademaster**

Members of the swordsman corps do not put as much effort into training with their swords as other ninja do into learning the basics of ninjutsu--they put in more. This rigorous training tends to leave members of the swordsman corp disproportionately grim, and exceptionally dangerous.

Type: Ability  
Cost: 10  
Requires: Precision

Effects:  
When making a sword attack you may choose to replace your regular accuracy with an accuracy roll (using 1d20 instead of 10 for the base value). If you choose to use your physical damage bonus with a sword attack, instead of your Sword Damage Bonus from the Precision ability (found directly below this one), you do not receive the benefits of Blademaster on that attack.

## **Precision**

Any ninja who uses a weapon seriously knows something about it beyond ;put the pointy end into the other person;. Mist's swordsmen generally understand their weapons, knowing the importance of a sword being well-balanced, and just how to cut someone to make the most of their weapon's momentum.

Type: Ability  
Base Cost: 5  
Scale: 5  
Limiting Attribute: DEX /20, Max 4

Effects:  
You have a special "sword damage bonus" of DEX/15 (to, as usual, a single decimal point). You may use this in place of your physical damage bonus whenever wielding a sword, if you prefer. Each rank beyond the first reduces the divisor by 1, to a minimum of DEX/12. Increases to your Physical Damage Bonus do not affect your Sword Damage Bonus. However, anything which reduces your PDB (such as many wounds) will also reduce your SDB.

## **Daisho**

Most members of Mist's Swordsman Corps have one sword which is distinct to them, and they learn to use it like an extension of their own body, often to the exclusion of other weapons. A select few, however, find themselves with the ability or desire to bond with a second blade. If these individuals are prodigious or lucky enough, they will discover a way to extend the soul of their original weapon into a second one, or develop a new one entirely in a different weapon.

Technically, "daisho" refers to a paired set of weapons used by samurai. It's a very precise word, with deep significance and a great deal of ceremonial importance. Well, at some point in the past some member of the Swordsman Corps decided to present themselves as a samurai, and adopted the term to refer to their own paired weapons. It caught on, because while ninja don't actually know anything about samurai behavior, it sounds impressive to claim you follow their ways, and now a "Daisho" among the swordsman corps refers to any set of weapons an individual has soul bonded with.

Type: Talent

Effects:  
This may only be taken after you have already bonded with a Sword through “The Blade Is Me, I Am My Blade” Ability. You are now able to use that Ability on a second Sword at the same time. This second Sword follows all the normal rules for that Ability with the exception that it must possess the same Personality Aspects as your first Sword.

## **The Blade Is Me, I Am My Blade**

Type: Ability  
Base Cost: 25  
Scale: 0  
Limit: XP/1000, max of 3

Effect:  
So long as you have been using a particular Sword for over 1 IC month, and the total Artisan Points used in the crafting of the Sword are less than 10+(XP/200), you may infuse a part of your soul into it through a hidden ritual. Once this is achieved, you permanently lose 1 maximum Willpower and become connected to your Sword in a way far deeper than anything achievable in the physical realm. As your own dedication and soul coalesce into the steel to give it a nascent soul of its own. You can only use this Ability and its benefits on a single Sword (And it must be a Sword, it cannot be any other type of Weapon), and once you choose which Sword it is, the decision cannot be changed.

Your Sword will begin to slowly evolve and grow in strength with you, something impossible for a normal blade. Your Sword will always be considered to have 10+(XP/200) Artisan Points which you may spend to gain any number of additional Traits/Features/Properties suitable for the Sword from the Weapon Crafting Section, but any of the Traits that the Sword had before this Ability was applied cannot be changed and take away from point total that you have. You cannot take Special Properties through this Ability. Any Traits that you choose cannot be changed.

Perhaps the most perplexing part is that your Sword will attain some form of a basic "personality", it is not rare to hear a skilled swordsman describe their blade as "moody" or "bloodthirsty" or even "joyful". This "personality" is more than just swordsmen being weird, it represents a very tangible manifestation of the strongest evolution that the Sword undertakes, developing a soul. The second and third Ranks taken in this Ability grant your Sword a Personality Aspect (Listed below), a semblance of the semi-sentience which your blade has developed and which grants you one Active and one Passive power.

No matter what else you pick, you always know where your Sword is thanks to this supernatural bond you’ve developed with it, in terms of distance and direction. It could be on the other side of the world, and given enough time, you'd be able to track it down. It also becomes indestructible, any Effects or Jutsus which would normally destroy Weapons would have no effect on this Sword. Additionally, even the most temperamental of blades have an unshakeable "loyalty" to their owner. Whenever your Sword is held by anybody but you, the Sword is only treated as possessing its Structure Traits, and nothing else. With them benefiting from none of its other Traits, Special Properties, or Personality Aspects.

### **Personality Aspects**

#### **Bloodthirsty**

This blade craves blood and violence, it grows sharper the more pain it inflicts. And once it is unsheathed, will not be satisfied until it has stolen the last breaths of its victim. The bad news is that the stronger you become, the more potent this blade's urges become.

Bloodthirsty cannot be taken alongside Aloof.

- **Active:** The Swordsman may elect to feed the bloodlust of their blade, entering a berserk state where only murder and blood could calm them down. As a Speed 6 Action, you enter a "Bloodthirst" Mode where the Passive benefits of this Personality Aspect is doubled Every time it is your turn, you must perform a Weapon Attack against a viable Target (no, a tree isn't viable, nor is the squirrel ON the tree. No bag of rats shenanigans are allowed) within range including move with attack. If there are no allies or enemies within range, then you will perform a Move Action or a movement Jutsu towards the nearest Target and then Attack them. No other Actions can be taken except for those relating to removing some sort of penalty (Such as a Grab's Break Grapple Action or the Action to remove Clay Bullet's Immobilization Penalty) until you have killed a Target, upon which you finally get the urges of your Sword under control. You will still receive the penalties of this Mode, but may perform the Speed 0 Action to finally leave it whenever you wish during your turn. You may also reach this state of control without the need of ending a life by attempting to subjugate the will of your Sword; roll a Resistance Check against a TN of 15+(XP/200), if you succeed then you may leave this Mode as previously stated. But if you fail, then you lose 1 Willpower point as if you had spent it. You may attempt this Check multiple times and at any point in the Initiative, but only once per every 20 ICs. If you no longer have Willpower points, failure will lead to you increasing by 1 Fatigue level, up to a max of the last Fatigue but once you enter this mode, you cannot exit it (which is a Speed 0 Action) until you have performed a Coup De Grace on an Target.  
- **Passive:** Whenever this Sword deals Damage, it gains a stacking (Damage dealt/100)% boost to any future Damage until it is sheathed again.

#### **Aloof**

This blade somehow carries no "presence" even when it's held or swung, as if its somehow immaterial. It cuts through the air, yet makes no sound. It can cut through all defenses, yet it feels weightless. Its shape an utter blur when in motion, making it difficult for any would-be victims to ever detect its lethal bite. Truly worthy of a sword that feels “out of this world”.

- **Active:** The swordsman may elect to give in to the void that exists deep within both their Sword, and themselves. By doing so, as a Speed 8 Action, their own actions become hollow, detached from the very significance of their deeds. Such detachment means no perceivable intentions that an enemy could utilize to predict the swordsman's strikes. As if they are simply another part of the world. You may only use Melee Weapon Attacks, the Damage of this Sword is reduced by 20% as you are simply unable to put your all into any of your strikes, but the Target's Defensive Actions or Interrupts against this Sword's Attacks count as double theirs Speed for the purpose of moving their IC only.  
- **Passive:** This Sword's Damage ignores the Target's DR and Armor, deals full Damage even during Partial Defense, and cannot be Blocked. 

#### **Cruel**

Even if this blade doesn't have serrated edges, it still feels like it. For reasons completely beyond the physical, this blade is capable of inflicting the most unimaginable pain with even the smallest of cuts that will linger with the victim, constantly reminding them of the blade that had cut them.

- **Active:** By increasing the Stamina Cost of this Sword's Attack by 5, you apply one additional Wound in the same Location of one Severity lower, minimum of Minor.  
- **Passive:** This Sword reduces the Target's Maximum Vitality (Or HP if Damage is applied to HP) by a value equal to one fourth of the Damage applied to Current Vitality (Or Current HP). This reduces Wounding Thresholds by 10% of the value that Maximum Vitality was reduced by.

#### **Compassionate**

A rare trait for a blade to possess, such blades cause no pain when they are cut, and indeed it can be hard to even tell when one is cut by such a blade. Truly, they are "kind" swords. And yet, even kindness can kill.

- **Active:** You may choose to lower your Sword's Damage for an Attack by \-10% for the purpose of Wounding, to a maximum of \-30%. For every 50-(X\*5), Damage you deal, where X is the amount of times you took the 10% reduction, your Sword applies an additional 2 Bleed that stacks with any Bleed that already gets applied by the Sword.  
- **Passive:** You are able to lower the Severity of your Wounds by one additional step, to a minimum of no Wound. And whenever you lower the Severity of a Wound, the Target takes half of their Threshold for that initial Wound Severity as additional Damage. This extra Damage cannot, in of itself, cause another Wound, and it can be mitigated by Armor and DR.

#### **Proud**

This blade carries an air of majesty and pride, emboldening the one who holds or gazes at it with an unyielding spirit.

- **Active:** By automatically increasing your Fatigue level by 1, you lift up your Sword high as a Speed 8 Action, and  cause every ally within the battlefield to ignore one Wound they had for the remainder of the fight as they are emboldened by the sight and aura of the Sword.  
- **Passive:** For every 50 ICs spent holding this Sword, you regain 1 Willpower that you had spent, if your Willpower is at max, then you do not benefit from this.

#### **Gloomy**

Something just feels "off" about this blade. It's unsettling even for its owner, as if something deeply malicious inhabited this blade. Just gazing at it sends a chill down one's spine, let alone coming in contact with its edge.

- **Active:** As a Speed 10 Action, this Sword will release its malicious aura outwards, sapping the lifeforce of all around it, including the holder of the blade. Everybody in a 5 Yard Radius alongside the holder of this blade must make a Stamina OR Chakra Check (their choice) of 10+(Gloom Counters they have). Using this Action resets any Gloom Counters that the Targets had.  
- **Passive:** Whenever this Sword strikes a Target, it inflicts them with a "Gloom Counter", once the Gloom Counters have reached 10, the Target loses one Willpower Point and the Counter resets. Wounds will give additional Gloom Counters according to their Severity (Minors: 1, Major: 2, etc...). If the Target has no Willpower left, then they will receive a Stun of 10 instead.

# **Terumi**

Terumi are one of the most powerful clans in Kirigakure depending on their circumstances. With access to a large amount of water they can overpower nearly any defense but without convenient access to an ocean or pool their abilities become costly and riskier to utilize. Due to this they are often relegated to protection of the village during war time. 

Typically red-haired and slender, the Terumi have a slightly exaggerated, but ultimately accurate, reputation for being hot headed and tending to react strongly (and often violently) to comments about issues they find sensitive. Whether what offended them was something a person actually said, or a simple mishearing on their part, doesn't seem to matter very much.

**Terumi begin with 1 less Unique Point and Elemental Aptitudes for Fire and Water. They also have Elemental Affinity for Futton, which includes Katon and Suiton.**

## **Futton \- Boil Release**

Combining fire- and water-natured chakra produces the somewhat inaccurately-named Boil Release; not all Futton techniques necessarily use boiling water. Some converted Katon instead manifest as a heated, often high-speed blast of corrosive mist.  
Any Suiton or Katon technique may be converted into Futton, with the following effects:

* \+5 Chakra cost.  
* Futton always deals Energy damage.  
* Optionally, Katon techniques may boil off up to half their Chakra cost in gallons of water, which are 'destroyed' and removed from the field.  
* Katon techniques which don't utilize water instead manifest as corrosive steam. When this condenses (after the technique is resolved), it adds 1/5 of the move's Chakra cost in gallons of water to the battlefield.  
* You may choose to boil off (remove from battle) up to half the gallons of water used in a technique. Each gallon 'destroyed' this way increases the technique's damage by 5%.  
* Blocking Futton reduces its damage normally. However, its damage for the purpose of inflicting wounds is based on its unreduced damage. The same applies to partial defense. To Clarify further, Terumi Boil jutsu are not reduced by anything that reduces damage for wound calculation, they use the number rolled in all cases, except where something explicitly reduces wounding damage.  
* Suiton techniques converted to Futton gain Burns equal to their Chakra cost divided by 5\.  
* Futton is strong against Katon and Fuuton, but weak to Doton.  
* Any technique that destroys water can only destroy or use water. It has no effect on things similar to water, such as touu's ice, senju's wood, etc.


## **Boil**

Channeling your chakra into an impending water-based attack, you boil it harmlessly away before it reaches you.

Chakra: 5 \+ X/2  
Speed: X/5

Effects:  
This can be used as a defensive Interrupt against any Suiton ninjutsu which requires gallons to be used. Make an Accuracy roll, with (CHA)/10 as a bonus. X is the amount of gallons used in the jutsu you're interrupting. If successful, the technique fails, and the gallons of water used in it are destroyed.

## **Fukasu Gafu \- Steam Canvas**

While letting superheated fog roll over oneself isn’t ordinarily beneficial, Terumi have developed a use for the Futton variant of Mekkyaku that is more than just a flamboyant effect, holding the veiling mist in place around themselves to create a personal shield of their element which combines perfectly with Kirigakure’s natural climate.

Type: Futton Ninjutsu, Rank D  
Chakra: 15  
Upkeep: 2  
Speed: 6  
Seal Speed: 8  
Gallon Requirement: 5

Effects: While you maintain this technique’s Upkeep you are veiled in a small cloud of heated mist, applying a \-2 Visibility Penalty to anyone trying to target you (though your own vision is not obscured by its presence), which stacks with all other forms of visibility penalties, unlike normal, and anyone who attacks you from Melee range is scalded by the fog, taking CHA/2 Damage that ignores DR for doing so. This extra Damage also applies if you were to perform a Melee range Attack, but it is not added alongside the total of your Attack’s Damage to determine Wounds, it is treated as its own separate Damage for all purposes (Wounding, Armor, Partial Defense, etc) If it is dispersed (such as from Cleansing Wind), the Visibility Penalty returns at a rate of 1 per 15 IC. The scalding damage only occurs if the Visibility Penalty is at its full strength (whether or not an attacker is actually penalized by it).

## **Sekai no Tokeru \- Dissolving World**

The Terumi ability to boil water and alter the pH of steam taken to a logical extreme, this boils all water within a broad radius within seconds, flooding the area with a rising hightemperature vapor.

Type: Suiton Ninjutsu, Rank B  
Chakra: 25 \+ X/5  
Area: Special  
Speed: 24  
Seal Speed: 22

Effects:  
This destroys up to your CHA in gallons of water. Water present on the battlefield will be boiled off first, and then water used in jutsu with upkeeps. It's centered on you, and has an Area of 50 or up to X/2, with X being the number of gallons boiled, whichever is higher.

It does X\*(ninjutsu damage bonus) damage to anyone caught inside the area. As is normal for a Futton technique, blocking and partial defense will not decrease the damage from its wounds.

## **Critical Pressure**

Type: Ability   
Cost: 10  
Limit: RES/20

Effect: You can store a number of steam counters equal to 3 \+ your ranks in this ability. You may increase the speed of any action or interrupt by 4 to release all of your stored steam for any of the below effects:

Propulsion \- You move 3 yards in any direction for each steam counter released.  
Target \- You may only link this to a damaging Futton jutsu with a single target. The attack increases its damage by 1d10.explode(5) per counter released. This may be used after the defense outcome is determined.  
Explosion \- You release a burst of steam in a 3y radius around you dealing (Steam Counter \* NDB) and knocking them back yards equal to the steam counters released.

## **Jōki Kikan \- Steam Engine**

The more the Terumi fight, the more "Heated" they tend to get, whether it be excitement, annoyance, or raw anger. This Heat slowly builds up inside of them, influencing and fluctuating the output of their Elemental Release until it reaches a critical point upon which, all of that Heat is explosively released. Before it starts all over again.

Chakra: 5  
Speed: 1  
Special: Interrupt  
Requires: Critical Pressure

Effect: You can use this Technique as an Interrupt after Boiling Off any amount of Gallons of Water. You gain steam counters equal to the chakra cost divided by 5\. This cannot be used on a jutsu benefiting from Critical Pressure.

# **Touu**

The Hidden Mist, and Water Country in general, has a dark past it would very much like to forget. And, while the Touu would just as much like for it to never have happened, they in many ways are symbolic of that dark, bloody past.

When the people of Water Country embarked on their genocide against bloodlines, they were remarkably successful. Shinobi within Kirigakure who possessed distinctive kekkei genkai were suddenly demonized by their peers, and would end up being 'killed in action' on routine missions or simply vanish. Several bloodlines vanished forever.

The Touu did not, despite being the proverbial poster children for 'powerful, dangerous bloodlines'. Their powers manifested at a very young age, and could be used even without ninja training. They weren't arrogant, but they were special, and that was enough for them to be feared, hated, and ultimately all but wiped out in an orgy of irrational hate and violence.

Decades later, Kirigakure found itself in an awkward position: it wanted to get as many of those bloodlines back as they could, but most shinobi with kekkei genkai were fearful and resentful of the village, at best, and guilt and old hatreds were slow to die down.

The Touu bloodline was forever diminished. The once-proud clan that had faithfully and efficiently served its village was no more; the village was left gathering up tattered shreds and trying to patch them back together, which all the success of a child trying to repair a torn-up work of art before their parents got home. Literally dozens of secret techniques were lost forever.

The Touu of the current generation are few in number, and tend to be cold, aloof, and perhaps a touch more prideful than is warranted. The wholesale genocide of your ancestors by the ancestors of your peers, at the behest of the organization you work for and the country you serve, is a little hard to get over. If people criticize them for being arrogant and thinking themselves better or different than everyone else... well, those criticisms always have an undertone of guilt to them. It's just as hard for everyone else to wash away that inherited shame as it is for the Touu to forget the taste of betrayal at the hands of those they served.

**Touu begin with 1 less Unique Point and Elemental Aptitudes for Water and Wind. They have an Elemental Affinity for Hyouton, which includes Suiton and Fuuton.**

## **Hyouton \- Ice Release**

Touu have the ability to use one of the coolest advanced chakra natures: ice release. This is obtained through a combination of water chakra and wind chakra. Ice release combined the flexibility of water with  the penetrating power of wind.  You may convert any Suiton or Fuuton technique into a Hyouton technique, with the following effects: 

* \+5 Chakra cost.   
* Blocking reduces the damage from Hyouton techniques by 25%  
* Unless an individual jutsu specifies otherwise, Hyouton inflicts Piercing wounds.  
* Hyouton's damage for the purpose of wounding is considered 25% higher, which stacks additively with any existing increases on converted jutsu (50%+25% \= 75%).  
* You may forgo rolling any or all damage dice when using a Hyouton Technique. Instead, treat those dice as though they rolled half their maximum value plus one (i.e. d6 becomes 4, d8 becomes 5, d10 becomes 6, d12 becomes 7). You must make the decision of how many dice to convert before you roll damage.  
* Fuuton converted into Hyouton may not be used with a fan, and gains a gallons of water requirement equal to half its chakra cost.   
* Gallons of Ice may be used instead of Gallons of Water to pay any part of the Jutsu’s Cost.  
* Anything that creates Gallons of Water instead creates Gallons of Ice.   
* Hyouton that use Ice to pay for its cost, or that create Ice, that hit an opponent apply an Immobilize penalty based on its Rank (E \= 1, D \= 2, C \= 3, B \= 4, A \= 5). This penalty fades at a rate of 1 per 10 IC since the opponent was last hit with a Hyouton Jutsu.  
* Hyouton is weak against Katon and strong against Doton and Suiton

## **Suitenhoufukyuu \- Water Sky Convergence**

Often considered the mark of the Touu bloodline, even moreso than their ability to use ice release ninjutsu. All members of the bloodline, even ones without ninja training, exhibit from a young age the ability to mentally control water. They can lift it off the ground, cause it to float between their hands, and even freeze it with a thought (or, conversely, liquify ice). 

For a child, this is limited to what's nearby, and what they can see; for a skilled ninja, they can actually sense the presence of significant bodies of water (this does not include human beings or large animals). 

You may use any water scattered about the battlefield to fuel your Suiton or Hyouton techniques, even if it’s normally inaccessible. This does allow you to seize control of someone else's water or techniques. Even if it's in a container, or is infused with someone's chakra, it's not off limits

You may take a Speed X action, with a Chakra cost of 5+2\*X, to freeze or liquify (CHA/30, minimum 1)\*X gallons of water on the battlefield. Ice may not be used in Suiton techniques; it can, however, be used to perform Hyouton (including Suiton jutsu which you have converted into Hyouton).

You can perform Suiton (but not Hyouton) jutsu without hand seals, by adding (the base Seal Speed \- CHA/10)/2, rounded up, to the action's base Speed. Normal alterations to Seal Speed (such as from Ninjutsu Specialist) do not apply to this ability. 

There are even legends of Touu once being able to drop rivers on people.

## **Hijutsu: Makyo Hyosho \- Secret Technique: Demonic Mirror Ice Crystals**

The abominable and tremendous ability, passed down only within the Touu Clan. It is a technique wrapped up in many mysteries. It was said that no method in existence can defeat this technique. In an instant, multiple mirrors of ice are created around the enemy, reflecting nothing but the user.  Once the user has entered the mirrors, it's possible for them to move between the mirrors at the speed of light. It's near impossible to follow attacks sent out from this incredible movement. As every mirror shows his reflection, one could say it's impossible to see all of the user's attacks. Even if the opponent tries to attack the real body, the user will have already moved to another mirror.

Type: Hyoton Ninjutsu, Rank C  
Chakra: 15+X/2  
Upkeep: X/2  
Range: CHA/4  
Speed: 12  
Seal Speed: 10+X/2  
Requires: X\*2 Gallons of Water and/or Ice in any combination

Effects: You create X Demonic Ice Mirrors. These remain stationary on the battlefield, even floating mid air. They are one yard wide, two yards tall, and a few inches thick. They may be attacked, but you must deal CHA\*2 Damage in a single attack to destroy one (otherwise they just regenerate). While within 1 yard of a Mirror the user may step into it and out any other mirror at will. Practically speaking, this means that the user can go from one mirror to any other mirror using only 1 yard of movement, and the user can draw range and line of sight from any of the other mirrors. This includes taking the Observe action (which is done from every Mirror) and things like Dodge, where you can calculate your movement versus an AoE as beginning at any Mirror.

If X is 20 or higher, this Jutsu forms a cage around an area. Stop tracking individual Ice Mirrors. Instead note a space on the battlefield as being the Cage, which has a Radius of up to your CHA/4 Yards. While within this area, the user steps into the Mirrors and begins bouncing between the Mirrors too quickly for the eye to see. This grants the following benefits:

* The user enters Level 1 Stealth, and may perform the Hide Action without any further justification.   
* The user may perform any form of attack while in Stealth without breaking that Stealth. The attack lowers the Stealth TN as though it were a Ranged Weapon attack.  
* They are immune to attacks except from people who have defeated their Stealth, and except from attacks that have an area that includes this entire Jutsu's area.  
* If someone attempts to leave the area of this jutsu, the user may perform up to a Speed 10 Attack, treating it as an Interrupt (ignoring the usual limits on Interrupt Speed). This attack only affects the person trying to leave. If you hit that person and deal damage, they can not leave the area for 5 IC and are knocked to the center of this Jutsu's area.  
* The user may consider themselves to be anywhere within the cage when they take an action.  
* An enemy who has found you (usually by beating your Stealth TN) is tracking your movements. They may attack you normally, treating you as being anywhere inside of the Cage when they attack. If you Hide again, this penalty is lost until the opponent again finds you.  
* Mirrors that form the cage reform instantly if they are destroyed.

This user can not benefit from this Jutsu, either the individual mirrors or the cage, if they are Grabbed or incapable of movement. Using this Jutsu again removes all previously established Demonic Ice Mirrors, releasing their Upkeep appropriately.

## **Hijutsu: Sensatsu Suishou \- Secret Technique: Thousand Flying Water Needles**

Water is gathered from the air, and then formed into dozens or hundreds (but 'thousand' sounds far more impressive) of long, levitating needles. Those needles are then directed at a single target at high speeds; the needles nearly surround the foe, making evasion especially difficult. Note that this is a Suiton technique, and as such can be converted to Hyouton.

Type: Suiton Ninjutsu, Rank B  
Chakra: 20  
Damage: Up to (CHA/6)d10  
Range: CHA/3  
Speed: 12  
Seal Speed: 14  
Requires: 2 gallons of water per 1d10

Effects:  
This technique's damage is considered 25% higher for the purpose of inflicting wounds, and it always inflicts Piercing wounds. If it wounds an enemy, it also applies one wound of the next-lower rank.

## **Hyouton: Jisarenhyo \- Ice Release: Earthen Consecutive Chains of Ice**

The user, through touch, causes ice particles to accumulate on the target. These particles will cause the person to freeze to death unless chakra is focused on maintaining body-heat. Even if the user can use chakra, attempting to use it for anything else will cause some immediate and painful frostbite.

Type: Hyoton Ninjutsu, Rank B  
Chakra: 28  
Upkeep: 6  
Range: Touch  
Speed: 14  
Seal Speed: 16

Effects: On a hit, you gain Upkeep 6 and this jutsu applies Immobilization 5 that is lowered by 1 every 10 IC the opponent goes without being hit by a Hyouton. So long as the upkeep is maintained, the ice particles on their body freeze them whenever their chakra fluctuates. If the opponent attempts a Chakra roll, their immobilization penalty is maintained as though they were hit by a Hyouton Ninjutsu. Further, they lose (Immobilization Penalty from Hyouton \+ Chakra TN/5)% of their current Vitality (or HP, if Vitality is depleted) plus their current Immobilization Penalty from Hyouton as damage that can not be reduced. 

Creatures who can’t use Chakra that are affected by this jutsu freeze to death in 100 IC. The upkeep can be maintained for up to one day. If you can reduce the Seal Speed to 0, then you may apply this Jutsu with the slightest touch. Done covertly or out of combat, you can forgo the Immobilization penalty and apply the Upkeep portion of this Jutsu. If done covertly, the opponent may make an Awareness roll against your Espionage to realize what you have done.

# **Hozuki**

Located on the outskirts of Mist village, the Hozuki have been gradually growing in power as a clan. Serving as the guardians and peacekeepers (or 'peacekeepers') of the village, the Hozuki have adapted well to Mist's militarization.

Their clan's unique talents also make them excellently suited for ambushes and 'enforcement' operations; should things turn against their favor, the ability to liquify oneself entirely allows them many options to retreat, regroup, and return with overwhelming enforcements.

Within Kirigakure, everyone knows that the Hozuki can turn into water, but few outside the clan truly understand that ability's limits. Murmuring of dissent become a terrifying prospect when one imagines that every puddle or drain pipe could contain a Hozuki listening in.

**Hozuki start with the Elemental Aptitude and Elemental Affinity for Suiton.**

## **Suika no Jutsu \- Hydration Technique**

The Hozuki clan's pride is the ability to liquify their entire entire body, from bones to organs to hair, turning into living water. Although they normally maintain a humanoid form, there is nothing preventing them from turning into a puddle and slipping under a door or escaping down a drain--though they lose their ability to perceive their surroundings if they don't keep at least their head intact.

Type: Suiton Ninjutsu, Rank D  
Chakra: 15  
Upkeep:5  
Speed: 10

Tags: Defensive

Effects:

You enter a Hydration Form where you become a semi-liquid mass that’s gelatinous in consistency. Your Hydration Form is extremely resistant to physical forces and grants you unique elemental interactions. You may exit your Hydration Form as a Speed 5 Action.

Your Hydration Form grants you the effects mentioned below:

* Any Armor, Weapons, or Gear you were holding/wearing are absorbed into you, you do not gain any of their benefits and you cannot “hold” anything as you have no hands to hold things with. When you exit your Hydration Form, your Armor and Weapons are automatically worn once again. Your Equipment are inaccessible to everybody until you exit Hydration Form.   
* Your Movement speed is halved, and any Jutsus or Effects that move you only move you half the normal Distance.  
* You can still perform Ninjutsu, but any Seal Speed the Jutsu has is considered to be 50% higher while you’re in Hydration Form.  
* You can still perform Taijutsu, but the Total Damage of any Taijutsu Attack is reduced by 50%.  
* You take only 25% damage from Suiton and Taijutsu attacks.  
* You take  50% damage from Katon and any Element Suiton is strong against  
* You take 150% damage from Doton and any Element Suiton is weak against  
* You take normal damage from Raiton, but if you receive any paralysis from a Raiton Ninjutsu, you are removed from Hydration.  
* You cannot be grappled or grapple other people, and if you were in a Grapple when you enter Hydration Form, you automatically escape.  
* You cannot be burnt, poisoned, or ignited, and ignore the effects of those statuses until you completely reform; their durations still decrease normally (and Ignite automatically ends).

When you learn this jutsu you always have an additional 10 gallons of water to use with Suiton jutsu, which nobody else may access. This water is never used up, or considered to be added to the battlefield (If you figure out why, you get a cookie). But for every Gallon you use for a Jutsu, you take 5 unreducible Damage to your Vitality (Or HP). You cannot use this water if you are suffering from a Paralysis effect caused by a Raiton jutsu.

## **Masakana Namiochiru \- Demon Fishwave**

Pulling in water from all around you and extending your chakra from liquifying form into it all, you turn a mass of animate water with a vague outline of yourself at the center. Despite the jutsu's name, the water constantly tends to change shape and features, but most who see it can swear they see something demonic formed. This not only offers protection to the user, but also allows them to come crashing down upon their enemies as well.

Type: Suiton Ninjutsu, Rank C  
Chakra: 22  
Upkeep: 8  
Speed: 14

Effects:

You cannot Dodge or Block while maintaining the Upkeep of this Jutsu. You absorb up to CHA Gallons of Water into yourself from the Battlefield and/or your containers (Meaning you can’t use the 10 Gallons that you always have inside of you). You may use the water you've absorbed into yourself in Suiton Ninjutsu, though you lose it permanently after. You may not use any regular Taijutsu while in this form, though you get \+Gallons/10 to your PDB. Additionally, and far more importantly, is that you gain a “Barrier” that coats and covers the core of your Hydration Form, this Barrier acts as a form of Armor, possessing an Absorption equal to (Gallons/5) and a Durability equal to (Gallons\*3). For every 3 Durability that your Barrier loses, you permanently lose 1 Gallon of Water that you absorbed, reducing your Absorption and PDB from this Jutsu as appropriate.

If you are hit by a Suiton Ninjutsu whilst in this form, you take no damage and any gallons used in the Technique are absorbed into you to a max of your CHA. 

Damage from Raiton based techniques passes straight through your Barrier, dealing damage to you instead of to your shield.

Damage from Doton Techniques does triple Damage to your Barrier’s Durability, and its Absorption is treated as half its actual value.

You have all the characteristics of Hydration Technique (except as modified by the above characteristics). The only Taijutsu you may actually use in this form is as follows:

### **Crashing Tsunami**

Type: Suiton Taijutsu  
Chakra: 20  
Stamina: 20  
Damage: 5d10+50  
Area: NDB  
Speed: 20  
Requires: Masakana Namiochiru active

Effects:

You may move up to CHA/2 yards when you use this attack, and you may collect up to CHA/5 additional gallons into yourself during this movement, assuming they are present on the battlefield, but not above your maximum amount. This technique is treated as Unarmed Taijutsu for both Attack and Defense, so (For instance) it may benefit from Sudden Attack, and is able to be parried. 

## **Obomizu Katamari No Jutsu \- Drowning Water Blob Technique**

After liquefying a portion of their body, the Hozuki manipulates the resulting gelatinous mass to encompass and surround their target's head, shutting off any access to air. Meanwhilst, tendrils of the Hozuki’s liquified bodypart their victim’s body, messing with the water content in the victim’s muscles to cause them to shut down while they slowly drowned.

Type: Suiton Ninjutsu, Rank B  
Chakra: 24  
Upkeep: 10  
Speed: 16  
Range: 3  
Requires: Hydration or Demon Fishwave to be active.

Effects: This Jutsu uses your Taijutsu Accuracy. If the jutsu hits, the Target’s arms and legs will be treated as if they are held by two instances of the Armlock and Leglock Techniques respectively, though you are not actually in a Grapple with them. Despite that, they can still escape this Jutsu through the Break Grapple Action. If they attempt the Break Grapple Action, then you use your CHA in place of your STR to determine the Grapple TN they have to beat. Additionally, this Jutsu is automatically ended if the Target is ever moved out of the Range, or if you use any Action besides Crashing Tsunami.

For every 10 ICs that pass while the Target is under the effects of this Jutsu, they will receive Suffocation of Severity 1 as they slowly begin to drown.

# **Niou**

The Niou clan possesses one of the most coveted techniques in the shinobi world: invisibility. Despite that, they've avoided becoming famous. There are very few Niou; rather than trying to generate a reputation that would have shinobi around the world terrified of their prowess, they downplay and obfuscate their abilities.

Their 'invisibility' is most frequently dismissed as more Mist ninja trickery, hiding behind veils of chakra-enhanced fog and ninjutsu. The Niou are happy to keep things that way, and their village quietly encourages this subterfuge. Even within Kirigakure, the Niou are few enough in number to be passed off as just a large extended family, not an actual ninja clan. Niou tend to prefer to adopt into their clan, and many of these orphans keep their original name, rather than take the clan's. They may pride themselves on membership, but possessing a different last name makes it that much harder for another shinobi to connect the dots.

Despite their outward appearance of being largely disconnected, Niou tend to have a close-knit companionship with each other, a mutual respect that transcends personal grudges. They are raised to be quietly but firmly loyal to their clan and village, and to prefer reserved confidence over boastful ambition.

Niou frequently gather together to brag of their exploits to one another, simply to avoid doing so to other members of the village, who may not fully understand their invisibility technique--everybody likes to brag, after all. 

The most desired goal for many Niou is to have their name permanently etched within the Clan’s “Memory Codex”, a very secret book closely guarded by the Clan which houses the names and history of the Clan’s most prestigious members. Due to the nature of the Niou’s operations and propensity for keeping their deeds hidden, many of them will be quickly forgotten by their village and country as a whole even if they served it loyally. And so the Memory Codex serves as the only way for a Niou to at least be remembered by the Clan after death for loyal and exemplary service. It is a privilege only given to very few Niou.

## **Genshin no Jutsu \- Invisibility Technique**

The pride of the Niou clan, and their most closely guarded secret: this wraps the user in a layer of chakra, and projects their surroundings across their skin. A slight distortion is the only indication that anything is out of the ordinary, the technique even providing the illusion of distance.

Type: Ninjutsu, Rank E  
Chakra: 10  
Upkeep: 4  
Speed: 8

Effects:  
You become invisible. While invisible, you may Hide at will, with a \+5 bonus; while hidden, you are always considered to be one Stealth category higher than you actually are for all purposes. When making a Stealth roll, or an Espionage roll to be unnoticed (such as pilfering something, or picking a pocket, or throwing a Flash Bomb) you roll 2d20.takeHighest(1) instead of 1d20. Those Espionage rolls also receive a \+5 bonus.  
Your dodge rolls while invisible receive a similar benefit:You roll 2d20.takeHighest(1) rather than 1d20. This doesn't apply to other defenses, or against area-of-effect techniques.

## **Meimei Arashi \- Invisible Tempest**

Wrapping a weapon or held object in your chakra-induced veil of invisibility is easy; unfortunately, that does not extend to thrown weapons, as their invisibility comes to an end as soon as they leave your grasp. This technique exists specifically to patch that hole in the Niou's invisibility: it allows you to veil one or more thrown weapons in your chakra, keeping them unseen until they've struck their target.

Type: Ninjutsu, Rank D  
Chakra: Special  
Requires: Genshin no Jutsu active

Effects:  
This supplements a Throwing or Multi-Throwing Attack by making it an automatic Surprise Attack. Its Chakra Cost is equal to the Stamina Cost of the attack being used. If used from hiding, this reduces your Stealth TN by only 2 each time it's used.

## **Encompassing Presence**

You project your chakra over another person, granting them invisibility as well. 

Type: Ability  
Base Cost: 10  
Scale: 5  
Limit: 5

Effects:  
You can conceal one additional person, or person-sized object, with Genshin no Jutsu per rank. This does require Genshin to be active on yourself, and each additional person concealed this way increases its upkeep by 2\. This requires you to make physical contact with them when it's first applied, and they must remain within (your CHA)/2 yards for its effects to persist. People and items concealed this way use your Stealth TN in place of their own; if you're hiding a group, you make only a single Stealth roll for the entire group.

## **Maboroshi no Jutsu \- Phantom Menace Technique**

Type: Ninjutsu, Rank C  
Chakra: 17  
Upkeep: 6  
Speed: 11  
Seal Speed: 13  
Requires: 3 Ranks in Encompassing Presence

Effects:  
You cause much of the surrounding terrain to go completely invisible, including even the ground. Leading to a large area where nearly everything is transparent and see through. You can specify which materials or objects are kept visible or invisible when initially activating this Technique (Making one wall in a house invisible, but keeping the one behind it visible.) so long as you vaguely know such material or object exist and their approximate location (Making every tree and bush in the vicinity invisible is fine, but choosing to make all rock except for precious gems invisible around you isn't). But this Jutsu can never affect characters and whatever they're holding or wearing. 

Everything around you becoming see-through carries a few interesting consequences: Nobody can use the Hide Action to enter Stealth in this Area, even if their target has a Visibility penalty of \-6 or higher. Nor can the Improve Hide Action be used either. Anybody that was in Stealth Level 2 or 3 in the Area is automatically taken down to Stealth Level 1\. If a Jutsu's Effect allows somebody to enter Stealth, then that somebody must roll 2d20s and use the lower result to determine his Stealth TN.

Anybody that is in Stealth through the "Genshin No Jutsu" Technique is not affected by the above mentioned penalties, and in fact, becomes even harder to see. They become able to use any Jutsu/Action without breaking Stealth, and instead take a \-5 penalty to their Stealth TN for every Action taken.

# **Kaguya**

Originally, the Kaguya clan was not much more than a bunch of blood-thirsty, barbaric warriors brought into Kirigakure for their ferocity in battle. Following a failed coup d'etat against the village, the clan was virtually wiped out--for nearly a generation, in fact, it was believed that they had become extinct.

The re-emergence of the Kaguya clan was discovered by one of Mist's hunter-nin, capturing a renegade ninja who had an unidentifiable body composition. Mist 'negotiated' their return to the village, and within a few generations the Kaguya clan had begun its rise to prominence. They were given their own compound and priority in missions, and became, once again, the most feared clan within Kirigakure.

Along with a kekkai genkai that is touted as the ultimate taijutsu ability, Kaguya are feared for their bloodlust and their refusal to surrender. They will often refuse to stop fighting against overwhelming odds, preferring a bloody death to a peaceful surrender and a long life.

Mindful of the Kaguya's past betrayal, all of the perks given to the clan came with restrictions. All Kaguya are branded at a young age with two dots just above their eyebrows, in the center of their forehead. While not especially well known by those outside of Kirigakure, within the village it is a marking that commands respect by most, fear by many, and suspicion by a few. Many Kaguya shave their eyebrows as well; it's something of a clan tradition, but by no means enforced.

While there are no official restrictions, in practice the ranks and positions of members of the Kaguya clan are closely monitored. It speaks volumes that there has yet to be a Kaguya hunter-nin. They're respected, but not trusted.

**Kaguya start with 1 less Unique Point.**

## **Shikotsumyaku \- Dead Bone Pulse**

The proper name of the Kaguya clan's advanced bloodline, this gives them the ability to manipulate their skeletal structure by infusing it with chakra. The primary capability is allowing the user to induce rapid, focused bone growth at will. Truly powerful Kaguya were dreaded as having indestructible bodies.

Type: Ninjutsu, Rank E  
Chakra: 15  
Speed: 7

Effects:  
You acquire any one Skeletal Modification.

## **Corpse Bone Chain**

Much like Kaguya themselves in a battle, their bloodline seems to grow stronger over time, with no apparent upward limit. That a Kaguya's power grows exponentially when compared to that of their peers is one of the factors that makes them so valuable to Mist--and so carefully watched.

Type: Ability  
Cost: 5  
Scale: 0  
Limit: Max Willpower

Effects:  
Whenever you acquire a Skeletal Modification, from any source other than Corpse Bone Chain, you may increase your Stamina penalty by 2 and gain any other Skeletal Modification (which does not have to be one that technique could normally provide).

This may be used a number of times per battle equal to your ranks in this ability.

## **Marrowlust**

While it may be unfair to depict the Kaguya as nothing more than a clan of bloodlusted savages, there is much truth in the generalization. Your average Kaguya hungers for battle on a near instinctual level, they desire to feel the body of an enemy broken between their hands or underneath their blade. And whenever they achieve this wish, they gain a rush of exhilaration so powerful that it has a tangible effect on their battle prowess. Even the most clear headed of the Kaguya are not immune to this equal parts curse and blessing.

Type: Ability  
Cost: 15  
Scale: 0  
Limit: 1

Effects:  
Whenever you apply a Wound to a Target using an Attack, you immediately acquire a number of Skeletal Modifications equal to the Severity of the Wound (Minor: 1, Major: 2, etc…)

## **Teshi Sendan \- Ten-Finger Drilling Bullets**

You can fire the bones off your fingertips at opponents. They fly faster than most weapons, and rotate quickly enough to literally drill through most defenses before losing their momentum.

Type: Taijutsu, Rank D  
Chakra: 10 \+ 2 \* X  
Damage: (5 \+ X)d12  
Range: 10+RES/5  
Speed: 10

Effects:  
You fire 2 \+ (X \* 2\) projectiles by expending X Skeletal Modifications, minimum of 0 up to a maximum of 5; your damage bonus for this attack is increased by 0.5 per projectile. Regardless of its actual Speed, it uses 5+(X \* 2\) as its Speed for the purposes of determining Damage. This attack deals Piercing damage. For the purposes of defending against Teshi Sendan it is considered a multi-throw, though it is not subject to other multi-throw rules.

For every Ossification Skeletal Modification expended, Teshi Sendan treats an Armor’s Absorption as if it is \-3% lower and a Target’s DR as if it is \-20 lower.

For every Blades Skeletal Modification expended, Teshi Sendan's damage is increased by 10% for the purposes of Wounding.

For every Spurs Skeletal Modification expended, Teshi Sendan applies a Poison Effect of a Severity of (Spurs expended) that lasts for 25 ICs. 

Any defenses with a set amount of HP or Durability (such as Earth Shore Return or Armor) take double damage from Teshi Sendan.

You gain X/2 amount of additional Skeletal Modifications from this Jutsu so long as they aren't of the same types you expended.

You may take Weapon Focus: Teshi Sendan, which decreases its Chakra cost appropriately.

Skeletal Modifications: Osteogenesis, Blade, Spurs

## **Tsubaki no Mai \- Dance of the Camellia**

By manipulating their skeleton, Kaguya are able to extrude weapons made of bone through their flesh, pulling them out the rest of the way and using them in combat. Despite being bones, these are stronger than iron.

Type: Ninjutsu, Rank D

Chakra: 15

Speed: 10

Effects:
You acquire any Small or Medium from the standard options in the Equipment section. You may then upgrade it using Artisan points equal to your ranks in Chakra Control \- 5. You may choose to double the Base Speed and Upkeep of this Technique to create a second weapon in your other hand during the activation of this Technique. Both weapons gain the dual property (for free) but the artisan points must be split between the 2 weapons.

In the hands of anyone but a Kaguya these have a \-3 Accuracy penalty. Your own bone weapons have a \+2 bonus to their Accuracy when you are using them. Other Kaguya using your weapons receive no penalty or bonus.

Skeletal Modifications: Blades, Spurs, Osteogenesis

## **Karamatsu no Mai \- Dance of the Larch**

This technique creates razor-sharp bone spikes all over the user's body, branching off from the existing skeletal structure. These bones can stop attacks on their own, or if necessary the user can spin in place, turning themselves and the area around them into a veritable death trap.

Type: Taijutsu, Rank D  
Chakra: 16  
Special: Interrupt  
Speed: 8  
Effects:

You can parry any Ranged Taijutsu and Ninjutsu Attack that occurs further than 10 Yards away, as well as any Melee Taijutsu Attack following the normal rules for parrying. You receive a \+1 bonus per rank of “Spurs” Modification you have active. If successful and the attacker was within 1 Yard of you, they also take damage from your Spurs as if they had struck you, plus your damage bonus multiplied by this technique's speed. This is considered a physical attack.

Skeletal Modifications: Blades, Spurs

## **Yanagi no Mai \- Dance of the Willow**

A multitude of bones protrude from the body, most commonly from the spine, ribcage, and shoulder blades, creating sharp spikes that extend outward in several directions, turning their entire body into a weapon. Thereafter, the user can focus on evasion and counter attacking, with minimal movement required to strike at anyone who comes near.

Type: Taijutsu, Rank C  
Chakra: 15  
Upkeep: 4  
Speed: 6  
Effects:

While maintaining Dance of the Willow's Upkeep, you may use a Speed 0 Action to spend 4 AP to attack someone within 5 yards of you with a “Spinal Thrust” Attack. By raising the cost to 6 AP you improve this Attack to Target everyone within 5 yards of you (Though it does not count as an AoE Attack). You may attack with this Spinal Thrust at most once every 10 IC, and it is always considered to be a surprise attack.

Spinal Thrust only deals (Speed \* PDB) Damage and is treated as a Speed 10 Attack, though it does not allow you to move as part of the attack; you do not delay your next action because of this, but that Speed is used to determine viable defenses and damage bonus. You can spend additional AP to lower the effective Speed further. Parrying Dance of the Willow reduces its damage by half and prevents it from inflicting wounds, rather than defending against it fully.

You acquire a Skeletal Modification every time you spend AP to activate Dance of the Willow’s Spinal Thrust Attack, but not when you first use the jutsu and pay its chakra cost.

Skeletal Modifications: Ossification, Blades, Spurs

## **Tessenka no Mai \- Dance of the Clematis**

Through the use of Shikotsumyaku, the Kaguya creates a bone weapon from one of the central bones of the body (typically the femur or the spine), which is then augmented further. The resulting weapon is both stronger and lighter than any metal, making it positively devastating in the hands of a skilled Kaguya. 

Type: Taijutsu, Rank C  
Chakra: 25  
Speed: 20

Effects:  
There are three weapons that can be created with this technique. Each requires a separate use of this Technique and a minimum of 5 Skeletal Modifications Expended on this Technique:

Ultimate Spear: This creates a Large, One-Handed/Two-Handed, Piercing, Polearm Weapon

Ultimate Whip: This creates a Medium, One-Handed, Slashing, Chain Weapon with a Range of 15 instead of 5 and an additional \+1 Accuracy.

Ultimate Shield: This creates a Medium, One-Handed, Blunt, Club Weapon. It can be used as a Speed 8 Interrupt to Block an attack (this speed is not modified by Skeletal Modifications). The weapon breaks if you block an attack that deals 35% of your Maximum Vitality (before reductions) while holding it.This Shield blocks 75% of Damage rather than the normal 50%, and does not get reduced when Blocking Weapons or Fuuton (Or Para-Elements based on Fuuton).

Attacking with any of these weapons is a Stamina 20, Speed 16, Delay 5 Action. It deals 1d12 damage per Skeletal Modification you have Expended on it, and you may take the Weapon Focus ability for this weapon applying its benefit to all three versions. For each rank in certain Skeletal Modifications that had been expended on it, its effects are modified as follows:

Ossification: Ignores \-1 Base Speed

Blades: Damage is considered 5% higher for determining wounds

Spurs: \+1/2 Accuracy Bonus (Rounded Up)

Osteogenesis: \-2 Stamina cost

Skeletal Modifications: Any two.

## **Sawarabi no Mai \- Dance of the Seedling Fern**

The pinnacle of the Kaguya clan's techniques, this creates a countless number of bone spires around the user, creating an entire field made from their bones which they can shape as they desire. The field entraps and potentially skewers everyone caught in it, and the Kaguya can instantly travel from one bone to another by melding in and out of them.

Type: Taijutsu, Rank B  
Chakra: 30  
Damage: 3d12 per Skeletal Modification Expended  
Area: Physical damage bonus \*5 yards  
Speed: 20  
Effects:

This requires Expending a minimum of 5 Skeletal Modifications, yet has no maximumWhilst inside the Seedling Fern Area, and by expending one Skeletal Modification of a given type as a Speed 4 Action, you can use one of these following Effects: 

* Spurs: You may instantly move anywhere in the Area of Seedling Fern.  
* Blades: You immediately perform the Spinal Thrust Attack given by Dance of the Willow against everybody within the Seedling Fern Area , this ignores the "Once per 10 ICs" rule but does not give you a Skeletal Modification.  
* Ossification: By melding into and out of the bones ribs jutting out of the ground, you may remove any external Immobilization penalty (excluding those due to poison, genjutsu, etc.)  
* Osteogenesis: You may Hide, regardless of it'd normally be possible or not. When you hide, you begin at Stealth 2\.

Each of the Effects mentioned above can only be used once every 20 ICs. 

If someone attempts to escape the bone field, you may automatically Interrupt their action with any melee-range attack of Speed 10 or less by moving to them and attacking; if they are in Stealth when they attempt to do so, you gain a free Search roll. If you find them, then you may intercept them as normal. If you hit, this knocks them half of the way back towards the center of the field.

This is an Environmental, AoE effect. When used, this effectively destroys any other Environmental effects that require contact with the ground within the area (Swamp of the Underworld would cease to apply within the area, but a Hidden Mist would not). Inside the field, the Kaguya has a \+5 bonus to Awareness. If this technique is used again when already inside its radius, the two fields overlap and combine; nobody already in the field will be damaged again; and the cost is halved, after applying Osteogenesis' reductions.

Sawarabi no Mai deals Piercing damage. Even if someone dodges Sawarabi no Mai, they do not escape its area; they simply avoid being skewered by spikes of bone erupting from the ground.

After a few hours the bones will grow brittle as the chakra dissipates and begins crumbling. Within a day there will be nothing left but dust and bone chips.

Skeletal Modifications: Any three.

## **Skeletal Modifications**

As the Kaguya fight, their skeletal structure becomes increasingly better-adapted for combat. Every time you use one of your Clan Jutsu, you gain one of the following Skeletal Modifications. You can apply them repeatedly, their Effects stacking additively. 

The primary purpose of Skeletal Modifications, besides the passive benefits having them provides is their ability to enhance the Kaguya’s Clan Jutsu by “Expending” those Skeletal Modifications, losing them permanently in return for a powerful boost to the Jutsu. In such cases when Skeletal Modifications are Expended, you still retain their passive benefits for that IC and for the Jutsu you Expended them on.

You should be careful, however, as every time you suffer a Wound, you lose an amount of Skeletal Modifications equal to the Severity of the Wound (Minor: 1, Major 2, etc..). You may choose which Skeletal Modifications you lose yourself, unless the Attack was a Called Shot, in which case, the enemy will choose.

If you wish, you may suppress activation of these modifications. Suppressing any or all of your skeletal modifications is a Speed 0 action. Regardless, once combat has ended these effects all fade within an hour; bones retract into your body, and so forth.

#### **Ossification**

You extend your bones to cover your vital regions, forming broad, flexible plates. This gives you a damage reduction of (RES)/10, and can be applied up to 5 times.

#### **Blades**

Numerous spikes and blades of hardened bone protrude from your body in combat-useful ways, such as from your knees, extending past your hands, and so forth. This increases your damage bonus by 0.1 for Unarmed Taijutsu and weapons created by Dance of the Camellia, or 0.25 for clan Jutsu (including Dance of the Clematis' weapon), each time it's applied. You can apply this up to 20 times.

#### **Spurs**

Small shards and lengthier spikes of bones gradually cover your body, protruding from beneath your skin and injuring anyone foolish enough to strike you. Anyone who attacks you in melee range, including with any weapons of less than Large size, takes (your RES)/5 damage if they hit. This damage is also dealt any time they use a Grapple Jutsu against you. You can apply this up to 5 times.

#### **Osteogenesis**

The more a Kaguya fights, the easier it becomes for them to do so. Every application of this modification reduces the Chakra costs of your clan jutsu by 2. You can apply this up to 5 times.

## **Skeletal Realignment**

You recover from any one Blunt or Slashing wound of Minor, Major, or Severe severity by spending modifications already acquired as follows: 

Major: 1 Mods

Severe: 2 Mods

Critical: 3 Mods

So, if you were wounded with a Major Blunt wound, you would be able to expend 2 Skeletal Mods you already possessed (like Blades or Spurs) to cancel that wound. The same would apply if you had the wound previously.

# **Watanabe**

**All Watanabe start with 1 less UP**

## **Shōtsugan**

A disturbing and unnatural power even amongst the ranks of Dōjutsus, the Shōtsugan (Meaning the "Veil Piercing Eye") was supposedly inflicted upon the Watanabe Clan by an ancient and otherworldly force beyond human comprehension. As a punishment for an unholy transgression now long forgotten, the at-the-time simple ferryman grew a third eye upon their forehead which forced them to view the true nature of things, gaining a perspective of the world that humans were never meant to possess. Many of them went mad and died, but a select few managed to retain their sanity and survive, and soon, even turn this curse inflicted upon them into a boon which granted access to a shred of that otherworldly power. Allowing them to not only see the "truth" of all things, but to also "alter" it. Manipulating their own shape, the minds of others, and even reality itself.

Regardless of whether this story is true or not, the unnerving powers of the Shōtsugan cannot be denied. A twisted, grotesque organ pulsating with a dark energy, the third eye upon the forehead of every Watanabe is impossible to not spot even when closed shut. Even the shapeshifting powers of the clan which can fool even the Byakugan, cannot mask this third eye without the aid of a physical veil such as cloth. But few Watanabe ever bother with such trivial attempts at hiding their true nature unless they are on a mission, for they know more than anybody else, that the truth will always remain obvious in plain sight. And when they open that third eye, no truth can hide from them.

Upkeep: 2  
Speed: 1

Effect: You are able to perceive souls, which gives you a unique insight into the Nature of man. As their personality and the life they've lived so far is permanently etched upon their spirit, which is available like a stone tablet for you to read. You perceive an aura around each person which is made up of layers of colors, the outer layers representing their current emotional state: Whether it be fear, excitement, happiness, melancholy, etc. And the inner layers representing their true Nature as a person: Whether somebody is cruel, kind, cowardly, outgoing, short-tempered, passive, mentally disturbed, etc. You can even memorize the aura of a character so that you can tell them apart in the future through their aura's unique and personal hue of colors. You gain the following effects depending on the targets xp in relation to yours.

You have 500+ more xp then target:  
You can read them like a book able to discern specific information about the target such as their exact xp, wounding thresholds, remaining vitality/hit points, ninjutsu aptitudes, and any summoning contracts they have. You can also tell exactly when they are lying or attempting to mislead. You also gain all lower benefits.

You are within 500 xp of target  
You can view the surface of their mind learning key traits about the target but unable to probe further. You gain a \+3 to Diplomacy and espionage checks as well as know their natural Elemental Affinity (Including Advanced Elements). You also gain all lower benefits.

You have 500+ less xp then target  
You struggle to find the slightest hint of their inner power but can still see through abilities that affect your surroundings. This also gives added perception to see through simple techniques of an illusory nature. You gain a \+4 to genjutsu defense rolls and are immune to Genjutsus of E Rank or lower. You can also ignore the effects of Bushin, Henge, and any other E-rank jutsu designed to alter your surroundings.

## **The Shape of a Soul**

(Flavor Text)

Type: Ability  
Cost: 10  
Scale: 0  
Limit: 1

Effects: You can alter your shape at will as a Speed 10, Chakra 10 Action to perfectly resemble the appearance of another person. Or make up an entirely original appearance. This is different from normal Transformation Techniques such as Henge in that it is altering the appearance of your soul as well. Even Dōjutsus such as the legendary Byakugan or those with the rare gift to sense chakra or the ability to harness Natural Chakra cannot tell you apart from the genuine article, except for another possessor of the Shōtsugan. Who'll immediately know your soul's true appearance and automatically identify you. If you choose to turn into another person, copying their appearance, then your transformation is flawless, even details which you had no way of knowing are perfectly copied as you are mimicking them through their soul and not their physical appearance. And only those who have an intimate familiarity with the person (Typically friends and loved ones) have any chance of telling you apart, rolling an opposed Awareness check vs your Espionage or Diplomacy.

## **Shin'en No Shisen \- Gaze of the Abyss**

(Flavor Text)

Type: C Rank \- General Genjutsu

Effect: You impose the true form of your tainted soul upon the material world, which changes how your physical body looks. Shifting into an incomprehensibly disturbing monstrosity (Every Watanabe must choose a permanent appearance for their monstrous form when they gain this Jutsu) whose mere appearance can cause the minds of any who gaze at you for too long to shut down. Unlike other Genjutsu, this effect cannot be resisted by a Genjutsu Defense roll and is automatically applied to all who look at you. It also cannot be negated or countered by the Byakugan or the Sharingan respectively.

Starting from the moment they look at you, everybody gains a Sanity Counter with a threshold equal to (Their Max Willpower \* 5). Every 1 IC that they spend looking at you, their Sanity Counter increases by 1\. If the Counter ever reaches the threshold, they'll automatically lose 1 point of Current Willpower (Which does not count as spending it for any effects that care about that) and then the Counter resets back to 0\. If their Current Willpower is 0 when their Sanity Counter reaches its threshold, then they'll instead automatically advance a Fatigue level. Which can eventually cause them to fall unconscious from the pressure of your disturbing presence. Temporary sources of Willpower such as those granted by the Determined Unique DO count for any of these conditions. Meaning that if a target’s Sanity Counter reaches its Threshold while they have no Current Willpower except for Temporary Willpower points, those Temporary Willpower points will be consumed first before they begin to Fatigue. 

Somebody that is being affected by your monstrous form can somewhat mitigate the strain on their mind by simply looking at the edges of your form, or their own feet as a Speed 1 Action, which applies a \-4 Visibility penalty to them. When they do this, their Sanity Counter still increases as normal, but when it reaches the threshold, they can do a Genjutsu Defense vs your Genjutsu Offense roll with a penalty or bonus equal to twice the difference between their Current Willpower and your Current Willpower.

Effect: The Target receives a penalty or bonus to their Genjutsu Defense roll against this Technique equal to (Their Current Willpower \- Your Current Willpower) \* 2\. You cause the Target to go temporarily mad. Whenever the Target takes a non-Interrupt Action, they declare it as normal (The declaration cannot be changed after it is made), but before anything resolves or the Action is reacted to, the Target must roll a 1d100, and change their Action accordingly:

* 1 \- 69: Your Action proceeds as intended.  
* 70 \- 84: You must target the nearest character with your Action that wasn't your original Target (Even if it was an ally). If there are no other possible targets within the range of your Action, or if it's an Action without a Range (Such as Search, or a self targeting Jutsu) then you simply fail to perform the Action as you burst into a fit of screaming, laughter, or weeping. You don't pay any Stamina or Chakra Costs, but must still pay the Speed and AP spent.  
* 85 \- 100: You target yourself, if the Action has an Area then it's centered on you, and will affect you as well even if it normally wouldn't. If the Action has no effect on you (Such as a Search Action) or was already self targeting, then you simply fail to perform the Action as you burst into a fit of screaming, laughter, or weeping. You don't pay any Stamina or Chakra Costs, but must still pay the Speed and AP spent.

Anyone who falls under this Genjutsu discovers they are under this genjutsu X \* 3 IC after they fall under it, with X being the amount they failed their Genjutsu Defense roll by.

## **Kūkan-Teki: Yuganda Shinjitsu \- Spatial Dissonance: Distorted Truth**

Type: B Rank \- General Genjutsu  
Chakra: 37  
Speed: 18  
Seal Speed: 21  
Requires: Gaze of the Abyss active.

Effect: This Genjutsu does not require an immediate Genjutsu Defense roll from Targets. It cannot be negated or countered by the Byakugan or Sharingan respectively. And it affects the entire battlefield. You distort reality for other people within a wide space, even changing what counts as the Truth within that area for others. 

Whenever somebody has a Sanity Counter that reaches its threshold, in addition to its normal effects, they also have an Non-Interrupt Action performed by them in the last 50 ICs of your choice deemed as a Lie. That Action's Truth is distorted so that it is mostly or completely nullified as if it had never happened or simply failed, with all Effects of the Action removed or altered as follows:

* The Action is treated as if it had not hit or affected anybody for any effects for which that matters (Jutsus, Poisons, Uniques, Abilities, etc...), and those effects get reduced or nullified as appropriately on the same IC that the Counter reaches its threshold. Any Damage caused by a Poison applied through the Action are reverted, any bonuses or penalties such as Relentless' DB boost caused by the Action are reset, any Status Conditions or Effect caused by the Action are removed and the Damage caused by them (Like Bleed's) is reverted. This can even lower somebody's Fatigue Level if their Fatigue Level increased directly because of the Action's effects (Such as through a Suffocation Condition). However, any byproducts of these effects remain, such as somebody getting hit afterwards by another attack because of a Paralysis Condition applied by the Action, or somebody failing a Fatigue Check unrelated to the Action's Status Conditions or effects (Even if the Fatigue Check would have been passed had it not been for a Stamina or CE penalty applied by the Action).  
* Consequently, any resources spent initially avoiding the Action, such as ICs spent on an interrupt, AP, Willpower, or Fatigue costs, do not get reverted or returned. And "Distorted Truth" can never revert time or bring your IC lower than what it currently is when this Technique's effect triggers, barring Stuns (explained further below).  
* Any resources or costs spent on the Action itself similarly do not revert. This extends all the way from Fatigue Checks, AP, Willpower, Speed Cost, items consumed (such as Shuriken), etc. They are all still spent.  
* All Damage and Wounds caused by the Action are instantly healed, but any resources already spent to mitigate or nullify the Damage or Wound (Such as spending a Willpower on a Henzaki's Organ Mobility, or the costs of a Medical Ninjutsu)  do not return or revert. Any additional Damage caused directly by the Wound, such as it giving Bleeding, is also healed. But any byproducts of the Wound's presence (Such as somebody getting hit afterwards because of the Wound's penalties) do not get reverted. The Wound also does not count as having ever been applied for the purposes of Wounds who's penalties scale based on how many Wounds have been applied (Such as the Collapsed Lung Wound).  
* Environmental Effects created by the Action are removed, and any Status Conditions or secondary effects of the Environmental Effect are reverted as well. Damage caused by the the Environmental Effect (Such as through Earthworm's movement based damage) is instantly healed. The penalties of Environmental Effects such as Mist Blaze Dance's Suffocation are also reverted, which can reduce your Stamina penalties or even Fatigue Level if appropriate (Should have failed a Suffocation check directly applied by the Environmental Effect).  
* Any Upkeep caused by the Action is instantly cancelled, as does any of the Upkeep's benefits or penalties. However, the byproducts of the Upkeep's existence (Such as failing a Fatigue Check because of the Upkeep) remain. For Weapon Creation Jutsus, while the weapon disappeared and the Jutsu is cancelled, the effects of any Attacks or Techniques performed with the weapon remain.  
* If the Action led to a Grapple or allowed the Initiator to enter Stealth. Then the Grapple immediately ends, and the initiator is immediately revealed from Stealth. But any Actions or effects that happened in between the Action and "Distorted Truth" triggering, remain.  
* Any direct movement caused by the Action, whether to the initiator of the Action (Such as through Vaulting Leap), or to a Target of the Action (Such as through Knockback) is also negated. All those moved by the Action are instantly moved back to where they were before the Action had moved them, even if they had moved somewhere else in the duration between the Action and the effects of "Distorted Truth".  
* Any remaining Stuns caused by the Action are instantly removed, and Stun’s target IC is moved back to the earliest possible IC to the maximum of the Stun they had as if done through Principle of Motion. Just like the normal Principle of Motion, this cannot rewind time.

Everybody in the battlefield will get a vague sense that reality has been distorted, but will no longer be able to recall the Action that has been rewritten. And their memory will be altered such that the new course of events without that Action vaguely make sense. They can attempt to recall the true course of events only once they are out of Combat, rolling Research against your Genjutsu Offense, but should they fail, then they cannot try again.

If a Target has averted their gaze from your monstrous form (taking the \-4 Vis pen) to mitigate its effects then the effects of "Distorted Truth" will only apply should they fail their Genjutsu Defense roll.
