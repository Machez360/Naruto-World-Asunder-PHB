# Getting Started

**Welcome to Naruto World Asunder. Below is all the information and links required to make your character.** 

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Character Concept

Character creation is often much easier if you start with a concept. It doesn't have to be thorough or deep; something as simple as a name, a chosen village, or some key personality traits can make an excellent framework to build around.

If you don't have a particular concept, that's okay\! Feel free to just make it up as you go along. You might find inspiration along the way, especially if it's your first time making a character. And of course, don't be afraid to ask for help\!

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Village and Clan

 A solid next step is to choose which of the playable Hidden Villages your character is from. This is where your character was trained, who they're loyal to, and ultimately who they work for. Cultures vary between Villages, so you may want to read the Village Information pages for a general idea of each one. But for the most part, it's okay if you don't fit the mold of your village--ninja are expected to be a little... odd.

Every village is also home to several ninja clans. Clans are largely formed by blood or by covenant, and have special techniques tied either to their bloodline, or their other closely-guarded secrets. These techniques are forbidden to outsiders, and one cannot "join" a clan; you are either born into one, or you are not. There are exceptions, but such exceptions must be discussed with a GM, just to make sure.

Choosing a clan is not mandatory, and clanless ninja have their own benefits: a bonus 10% XP, 1 Extra Unique Point, and an extra XP/100 Skill Points. These benefits are further explained in later pages.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Choose Uniques

 Uniques are, as the name implies, unique aspects of your character that give them an edge in life. A new character begins with 5 Unique Points (UP) to spend, though some clans start with one less due to the power of their techniques. UP can be spent at nearly any time\*, though Creation Uniques can only be gained at Character Creation. Uniques are covered in greater detail in the Uniques page.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# [Determine Attributes](#attributes)

Attributes (also known as Stats) represent your characterâ€™s raw capabilities. The five attributes are: Strength (STR), Resilience (RES), Chakra (CHA), Dexterity (DEX), and Agility (AGI). More information is covered in the Attributes page.

A new character starts with 20 in all Attributes. They also begin with 25 points to distribute among their attributes as they like, with no more than ten in a single attribute.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Starting XP

Your starting XP will influence other aspects of the character creation process, including number of Skill Points, maximum Skill Ranks, and prerequisites for certain Jutsu and Abilities, but remember that you can always ask for help if you're uncertain which is best for you. Starting XP is as follows:

500 XP, starting at Genin status.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# [Choose Skills](#skills)

A new character typically has XP/25 Skill Points, which can be spent on any of the game's 12 skills.

Clanless Ninja instead gain an additional XP/100 Skill Points. Some Uniques or other sources may further modify these amounts, as listed in their individual entries. Skills and Skill Points will be further explained in the Skills page.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Spend Starting XP

With your uniques, starting attributes, and skills decided, it's time to spend your XP\! XP can be used to learn new Jutsu and abilities, and to increase your attributes\! These options are further explained in their respective pages.

Novice Ninja often learn the E-Rank Ninjutsu techniques Kawarimi, Henge, and Bunshin before their graduation to Genin. These are not mandatory, but they can be very useful. A rank in the Elemental Aptitude ability (detailed in the Chakra Abilities page) can also be useful.

Suggestions aside, you may spend your XP on whatever you feel makes most sense for your character.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Submit Sheet to GM/ST

When you feel your sheet is complete, have a Gamemaster (GM) or Storyteller (ST) look over it to make sure everything is in order. This also allows the sheet to be added to their records for bookkeeping and planning purposes.

It is optional but recommended to also include a character background for your character. It doesn't have to be particularly long or complex, just something that gives the GMs and STs some personal character hooks they can work with regarding your character in the future. On the official sheet, this can be placed in the Character Bio tab.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 

# Just Remember\!

***Unique Points, Experience Points, and Skill Points cannot be spent during combat, or during any events that you are a part of; they may only be spent before or after.***

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# **Attributes**

## **Primary Stats**

Attributes (also commonly referred to as statistics, or 'stats' for short) are numerical representations of your character's overall physical condition: how strong they are, how fast they are, and so forth. They are the baseline for determining performance.  
The five primary attributes make up, in game terms, the core of a character's capabilities. Baseline 'normal human' stats are around 20\. Ninja characters will quickly exceed these numbers. This is a result of them learning to harness the chakra in their body, and benefiting from the symbiotic relationship that chakra has with their body.

Strength (STR)  
Strength is a measurement of your ability to exert physical force on the world around you. Exceptionally strong people may be correspondingly muscular, though ninja have developed many training methods which leave them deceptively lean.

* Your physical damage bonus is STR/15.  
* Your Vitality is (RES\*8 \+ STR\*4)

Resilience (RES)  
This is your body's ability to endure hardship without suffering from debilitating injuries. Many ninja believe that it's best to avoid being hit entirely... but nobody will say that not being able to take a blow is a good thing. 

* Your Vitality is (RES\*8 \+ STR\*4)  
* Your HP is (RES\*3 \+ CHA)  
* You add RES/10 to your Stamina rolls

Chakra (CHA)  
Every ninja is fueled by chakra, a mystical force that suffuses the world and fills the bodies of all living things, much like 'ki' in certain belief systems. This stat measures both your reserves of raw chakra and your ability to harness them.

* Your ninjutsu damage bonus is CHA/15.  
* You add CHA/10 to your Chakra Exhaustion rolls.

Dexterity (DEX)  
Representing your deftness, precision, and ability to quickly respond to changes in your environment, dexterity is very important in combat, as it is what enables you to actually hit things that are moving (such as other ninja).

* Your base Accuracy bonus is DEX/10.  
* Seal Speed of jutsu you perform is reduced by DEX/10.

Agility (AGI)  
The sister attribute to dexterity, agility is how quickly you can react to danger, how fast you can move, and, as the name suggests, how agile you are overall.

* You add AGI/10 to your Dodge rolls.  
* You add AGI/10 to your Initiative rolls.

## **Secondary Stats**

Vitality (Vit)  
Vitality measures your character's ability to shrug off damage, to turn a dangerous blow into a glancing one, and to take a beating without being seriously injured. You have a current and maximum vitality; whenever you take damage, you reduce your current vitality by that amount, though your maximum Vitality is unaffected.

* Your vitality equals your (RES\*8 \+ STR\*4).

Hit Points (HP)  
Hit points are like your 'life force', representing injuries that have significantly harmed you and caused serious damage to your body. After your Vitality reaches 0, you take damage to your Hit Points; an attack which depletes your Vitality has the rest of its damage carry over into your HP.

* You have (RES\*3 \+ CHA) Hit Points.

Damage Bonus, Physical (PDB)  
As the name would suggest, this increases the damage you do with physical attacks. Full details on how can be found in the Combat chapter.

* Your damage bonus is STR/15.

Damage bonus is unique in that it is calculated to a single decimal place. For example, with STR of 25, you'd have a damage bonus of 25/15.0 \= 1.666 \= 1.6

Damage Bonus, Ninjutsu (NDB)  
This functions practically identically to physical damage bonus, except that it applies to attacks based on their potency of your chakra rather than your physical strength, which generally means ninjutsu..

* Your damage bonus is CHA/15.

Willpower (WP)  
Your overall strength of will. This is both your raw determination, and your confidence in your body's ability to keep going, and perform at a higher level, even when it, well, can't.

* You have a base WP of 3 which can be increased mainly through uniques (such as Hidden Potential) or the Determined ability.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# **Skills**

Skills represent broad, generic things ninja do, and how well your character can do them. Unlike abilities or jutsu, the exact method of performing a skill is ambiguous; you might use stealth by hiding in foliage, or by camouflaging yourself, but in game terms it's all about the same.

Your skills all have a limit of 5 \+(your total XP)/200 Ranks. A lot of them benefit from practical application and general worldliness. Actually increasing your skills up to that limit, however, requires you to spend skill points.

You get 1 Skill Point for every 25 XP you gain; this happens automatically, for free, and you cannot buy more skill points.

A single skill point raises a single skill by one rank.

Clanless characters gain an additional skill point for every 100 XP.

For example, if you had 600 XP you would have a total of (600 /20 \=) 30 skill points, and you could raise any of your skills up to rank (5 \+ 600/200 \= ) 8\. You could use this to raise your Stealth to rank 8, your Awareness to 4, Chakra Control to 6, Resistance to 5, and Survival to 1 (8 \+ 4 \+ 6 \+ 5 \+ 1 \= 24). A skill roll is 1d20 \+ (your ranks in the skill). Even if you haven't raised a skill beyond zero, you may still make a plain 1d20 roll when attempting to perform a task that would call for that skill.

### **Athletics**

You use athletics when you perform acrobatics, leap across a chasm, try to navigate difficult terrain, weave your way between traps, swim across a river, or so forth. You can flip, tumble, and keep your balance under difficult circumstances.

### **Awareness**

How perceptive you are. This applies to things like hearing a faint noise, noticing that you're being followed, spying on a single conversation in a crowded room, and finding an enemy hiding from you in combat.

### **Chakra Control**

This is your ability to control the flow of the chakra within your own body, using it efficiently and shaping it precisely to do what you want. To a limited extent, it also represents how intuitively aware you are of the nature of chakra in general, and might allow you to notice when something's unusual about the surrounding chakra.

### **Espionage**

Something of a catch-all skill, this includes most things shady and underhanded. Pickpocketing, lock-picking, setting and disarming (or sabotaging) traps, forging documents, sleight of hand, and disguising yourself all fall under the umbrella of espionage.

### **Medicine**

You have knowledge of the human body and how it works. This includes biology, first aid, and at higher levels actual medical procedures and requirements. With a few ranks, you can probably apply a tourniquet; with enough, you might even deserve a 'Doctor' in front of your name (but good luck actually getting any respect\!).

### **Research**

Book smarts, overall knowledge, and an ability to gather information. Research can be used to solve complicated code and ciphers, find information in a library, and get up to date on the latest gossip when in a new town.

### **Resistance**

Not to be confused with resilience, this is how well your body is able to fend off the ravages of the environment and all sorts of unpleasantness that might befall it, from blistering heat to poison to burns. This is primarily useful for fighting off unpleasant status effects that may afflict you, both in combat and out.

### **Stealth**

How well you can sneak around, keep out of view, and not be obnoxiously loud. Whenever you need to be unobtrusive, hide from enemies, or move from point A to point B being noticed, stealth is your best friend. A ninja who can't be stealthy probably won't get very far in their career without some significant redeeming qualities.

### **Survival**

This lets you forage for food and move easily through hostile environments. While resistance might keep sunburn at bay while stranded in the desert, survival will help you find the nearest oasis and make an umbrella out of palm fronds. It's also used to track people and animals, and avoid being tracked.

### **Diplomacy**

Your innate charisma and ability to speak, this allows you to speak convincingly in any form. From logical analysis proving your point beyond a shadow of a doubt, threatening them to agree to what you want, to saying trust me bro and people believe you because youâ€™re just a trustworthy guy.

### **Artisan**

The skill that defines crafters as it allows you to wellâ€¦craft. When you take this skill you must specify either Weapon Artisan or Armor Artisan choosing the types of equipment you specialize in. This skill determines what you can create as well as how quickly you can have it done.

### **Toxicology**

This represents overall familiarity with poisons. While high enough medicine might be able to identify a poison, its symptoms, and how to treat it, toxicology knows what plant or animal that poison comes from, how long it takes before effects set in, and just how deadly it can be. Many medics have enough of this skill to be helpful in their work... but it's also very handy if you find yourself needing to poison someone.
