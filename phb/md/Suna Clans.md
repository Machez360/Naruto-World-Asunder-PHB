## **Henzaki**

Possessed of a rare, yet subtle, kekkei genkai, Sunagakure's Henzaki clan is virtually unknown outside of their village. Even within Sand, the most an average person knows about them is that they have some manner of secret technique, body modification, or bloodline which makes them hard to kill.

It is a bloodline, one which gives them an incredible ability to survive against adversity. Injuries which should be fatal prove only a minor inconvenience to the Henzaki.

The Henzaki have few defining characteristics as a clan, though many are swarthy and dark-haired. All are in good physical shape, their metabolisms self-regulating to prevent them from ever becoming over- or underweight. Henzaki virtually never get ill, and never seem to age past their forties.

A well-known fact among Sunagakure's medic nin is that the Henzaki's bloodline makes them all universal donors and universal recipients, both for blood transfusions and organ transplants.

### **Homeostasis**

Henzaki physiology has an incredible ability to adapt, responding to any changes in its environment or condition, every system function of their body reacting instantly with a single goal: maintaining the stability of their vital functions.

Type: Ability  
Cost: 20

Effects:  
You reduce the Poisons status of poisons by RES/40, and take damage every 2 IC, rather than every IC. If the poison's Poison severity is reduced below half by this, all its other effects on you are negated. Similarly, you reduce the severity of any received Bleed statuses by RES/30, and take damage every 10s IC, rather than every 5 ICs. Note that you still reduce your bleeding ranks as normal every 20 IC.

Bleeding from sources other than the Bleed status (for example, the Critical Piercing Wound 'Punctured Liver') is halved, and has its duration halved; if it does not have a set duration, it stops after 100 IC.

Suffocation effects do not force you to make Stamina rolls, but still apply normally. Even if you're killed, you won't truly 'die' until reduced to \-200% HP; you'll seem dead, all vital signs stopped, but will then revive once you return to 1 HP.

### **Regeneration**

Among those who've worked alongside Henzaki for any prolonged period of time, this is probably their most envied ability. A Henzaki will heal in minutes from injuries that would take others hours to get over, and in hours will have recovered from wounds that might take days for ordinary people to recover from.

Type: Ability  
Base Cost: 2  
Scale: 5  
Limit: 1 \+ RES /30

Effects:  
You regenerate 1 point of Vitality per rank each Initiative Count, and twice that amount of HP.

In a given day, you can only heal (rank) times half your maximums of each. Thus, at two ranks in regeneration, if you had 1000 Vitality you could only regenerate 2000 Vitality in a given day.

Finally, you divide the total healing time necessary to recovery from any wound that doesn't involve injured bones by 1+(0.5 \* rank). Medical attention cannot reduce it further; however, you can recover as if you had medical attention, even if you do not, thanks to your regeneration.

### **Organ Mobility**

The secret to much of the Henzaki's longevity, and their nigh-immortality, is their ability to control their body's internal structure. If an organ has been punctured, they can force the wound shut or use another organ to put pressure on it. If a compartment in their body is hemorrhaging, they can force the lining to open and let it bleed out to relieve pressure.

Type: Ninjutsu, Rank C  
Chakra: 15 \+ 5 \* X  
Speed: 8

Effects:  
You immediately recover from any wound which doesn't somehow involve your bones. The wound doesn't actually heal, but your body adapts in some fashion to function despite it. This lasts for 24 hours, \-6 hours per category the wound is above Minor.

You may spend 1 Willpower to use this when you're wounded (as a Speed 0 Interrupt in response to being wounded), in which case the wound is negated entirely--you simply don't suffer it, don't have to recover from it, and so forth.  
X is 1 for Minor, 2 for Major, 3 for Severe, and 4 for Critical wounds.

### **Sanguine Vitality**

As a result of their bloodline, Henzaki blood itself has a number of interesting, medically significant properties. Most relevant to shinobi, it can be rapidly metabolized by virtually anyone, and will induce temporary, rapid regeneration. It still tastes like blood, and since it has to be consumed fresh from the veins, it's not a particularly appetizing prospect.

Type: Ability  
Base Cost: 3  
Scale: 1  
Limit: 1 \+ RES /30

Effects:  
This requires someone to be close and still enough to drink your fresh blood. Generally speaking the Henzaki will cut open their palm or arm and suspend their regeneration, but simply biting them will suffice.

You can give up to 1 point of HP (not Vitality) per rank for every IC which passes. Each point of HP restores 5 points of Vitality (not HP) to the recipient. A person cannot die while receiving blood from you.

However, if either you or the recipient moves, or is forcibly moved (Such as by dodging), or takes any other actions, this effect is broken.

## **Hitori**

It's unknown how the Hitori came to be, despite plentiful speculation on the matter. The first possessor of their advanced chakra nature, Scorch release, was a single person who lived nearly three centuries ago. Long before Shinobi ever settled into the desert. Some theorize that centuries of living in the desert and being exposed to its 'natural chakra' may have had a lasting effect on some of the native people.

Battles involving Hitori outside of the desert leave their mark for days, the dry air and parched soil lingering as if they'd brought a little piece of Sunagakure with them.

Hitori themselves seem the very opposite of what you might expect from a clan that dries up everything around them, the essence of energy and youth throughout most of their lives. They tend to be very outgoing, with fiery red hair and occasional groups of freckles on their face and arms.

They tend to train on the outskirts of Sunagakure and frequently function alongside the Juugo Sato for this reason, often posted outside the village proper--the fact that their powers are so inimical to life, even that of other shinobi, may have something to do with that. Unwelcome guests within the Wind Country are usually run off by the Hitori, who use their abilities in a subtle fashion to create living conditions that quickly become unbearable.

Though a relatively new clan within the village, their abilities have earned them prestige and a respected place within its hierarchy, and in some ways they're considered to represent the spirit of the country they live in.

**Hitori begin with 1 less Unique Point and begin with the Elemental Aptitude for Fire and Wind. They also have Elemental Affinity: Shakuton, which includes Katon and Fuuton.**

### **Spirit of Perseverance**

The Hitori are the true children of the desert, the biting winds of the shifting sands that can strip flesh off bones and the burning heat of the Sun’s gaze which can boil one’s organs are nothing but a mild breeze and sunny day to the Hitori’s vigorous spirit. So in tune are they with these extreme conditions, that their bodies are physiologically superior to all others at withstanding these elements. It is not known if this inherent resistance is due to their Kekkei Genkai or a mere mutation of genetics, but every individual that worked with a Hitori has noted how they only need a few morsels of food and drops of water to remain at full energy for days on end, and how the Elemental Natures of Fire and Wind seem to affect them far less than their peers.

Cost: 20  
Scale: 0  
Limit: 1

Effect: You only need a single meal and one gallon of water a week to not starve or feel dehydrated, and are immune to the Extreme Heat weather condition. You also ignore half the Severity of any Burns you are currently suffering from, and reduce the damage of Katon and Fuuton Techniques by 20% for Wounding purposes.

### **Shakuton \- Scorch Release**

Combining fire and wind chakra results in the advanced nature of Shakuton, or “scorch release”; as the name suggests, it involves using extreme heat as a weapon, with powerful users being able to reduce opponents to ash or evaporate the liquid inside their body.

Any Katon or Fuuton Technique may be converted to Shakuton, with the following effects:

* \+5 Chakra cost  
* Shakuton cannot be Blocked, ignores half of the target's DR, and ignores Armor.  
* Shakuton Techniques receive \+(CHA/30) Accuracy Bonus.  
* Shakuton only deals 75% damage, but gains a \+100% Wounding modifier (Which is applied after the damage reduction).  
* Whenever a Shakuton Damage Dealing Technique hits a target, it applies a Dehydration status of severity (1 per Rank of the jutsu) \+ CHA / (80 \- 10\*Rank). In other words, for an E-Rank this is 1+CHA/70, for a D-Rank it is 2+CHA/60, and so on, up to 5+CHA/30 for A-rank techniques  
* Dehydration may not be increased past 3+CHA/8.  
* Katon transformed Shakuton Techniques do not inflict Ignite or Burns. Instead, they deal \+5% more Wounding for every stack of Burn and/or Ignite.  
* Fuuton transformed Shakuton Techniques do not have their inherent Wounding bonuses (The Wounding bonus from Shakuton, Uniques, and Abilities is still applied, however). Instead, those Techniques gain a Stun equal to (Wounding Bonus)%/15.  
* Shakuton is weak to Katon, and strong against Raiton and Fuuton.

### **Dehydration**

This is a Status Effect. Every stack of Dehydration you have applies a \-1 to Resistance rolls, Stamina rolls, and a \-0.3 to PDB . Dehydrate stacks fully with itself; Dehydration 3 added to Dehydration 2 making a single Dehydration 5 status.

You are suffering from extreme Dehydration, with the moisture literally stripped out of your cells, causing skin and bone to become brittle and sapping them of vigor. For every 3 stacks of Dehydrate, your Wounding thresholds are reduced by 5% and the amount of AP you gain every 20 ICs reduced by 1\.

When you advance a fatigue level, halve your Dehydration Status (Rounding up). 

Additionally, as Speed (X \* 2\) Action, you can drink X gallons of water from a container or from linking Water Creation Technique to the action (not off the battlefield; have some dignity\!), which removes X \* 2 points of Dehydration. Outside of combat, victims lose 2 Dehydrate every 10 minutes OOC (hour IC), but only so long as they drink plenty of water.

### **Shrivel**

Your very Chakra is calamitous to others’ existence, with a simple burst of intense Scorch Release you can cause water to evaporate and plant-life to wither. This is a Speed 8 action, and removes X\*3 gallons of water from the battlefield, with a Chakra cost of 5+X. The maximum for X is CHA/10. 

This cannot target water used as part of a sustained jutsu (i.e. one with an Upkeep). It affects things similar to Gallons of Water, such as Touu’s Ice and Senju’s Seeds, but only at half effectiveness. For example, if you were to have X=10, then you’d remove 15 Gallons of Ice or 15 Seeds. Rather than the full 30\.

### **Kasou no Jutsu \- Cremation Technique**

You focus your chakra on a victim, and simply light them ablaze.

Type: Shakuton Ninjutsu, Rank C  
Chakra: 20  
Range: CHA/2  
Speed: 12  
Seal Speed: 8

Effects:  
This jutsu cannot be defended against. The victim simply rolls an opposed Status Check. If the target fails the check, they gain Ignite equal to their current Dehydrate. Then halve the target’s Dehydrate, rounded down.

### **Sabaku no Keshin \- Incarnation of Desert**

You project your chakra out across the battlefield, with devastating results. The temperature rises, water begins to evaporate, some plants may start to wilt, and hopefully nothing nearby is particularly combustible.

Type: Shakuton Ninjutsu, Rank B  
Chakra: 21  
Upkeep: 6  
Speed: 12  
Seal Speed: 14  
Area: NDB \* 3 centered on self.

Effects:   
Change the Weather Condition within the Area to Extreme Heat. Everyone within the area except you has to roll a 5+(your CHA/8) TN Stamina Check when you activate this technique, and every 20 ICs they spend inside of it.

Furthermore, so long as somebody is within the area, any expenditure of AP is doubled for them. For example, if somebody wanted to reduce the speed of an action by 1, they’d have to pay 2 AP. Or if they wished to use Surge to gain \+1 ACC, they’d have to pay 16 AP. And for every AP spent, they take their current Dehydration stacks as unreducible damage.

## **Juugo Sato**

The Sand Foxes are not a 'real' clan, in any proper sense, and most members do not have any blood relation to one another. The clan often adopts orphans to raise and train.

What they lack in secret or bloodline techniques, the sand foxes make up for in training from a very young age to understand and be aware of the environment. It's by no means cruel or harsh, but it's more than what others go through.

Socially, they function much like any other clan, but have an unusually strong close-knit, even familial bond with one another. The sand foxes look out for their own. Within the village they're respected, and usually return the favor. Many are introverted--at least around people who aren't members of their clan--but few are sullen.

The Juugo Suto have a well-deserved reputation for being excellent trackers and firmly loyal to their village. Almost every team of shinobi sent to patrol the desert around Hidden Sand has at least one sand fox member, and even outside the Wind Country they frequently serve as scouts.

### **Survival Instinct**

Most clans pass on secret techniques as a rite of passage. The Juugo Suto have a somewhat different rite: once a member is ready they are left alone, in the middle of the desert, without provisions or equipment, and told not to return for at least a month; most of them aren't even teenagers. It's a testament to the clan that virtually every student is, in fact, ready to undertake this challenge, and returns safely to the village. It's a testament to the ordeal that they inevitably return from their journey changed: quieter, calmer, and infinitely more aware of the world around them.

Type: Ability  
Cost: 25

Effects:  
You are immune to surprise attacks. Attacks which would normally not end an opponent's stealth still do not do so, but they receive none of the benefits of surprise attacks against you.

Sneak attacks against you instead follow the normal rules for surprise attacks.

### **Tenacity**

The desert is some of the most difficult terrain to navigate, but the sand foxes do it. They adapt to the harsh environment. It's not that it gets any easier, or that they've learned any secret. They just face the obstacles, assess them, accept them, and do what they must regardless.

Type: Ability  
Base Cost: 5  
Scale: 10  
Limit: 4

Effects:  
You reduce the severity of any immobilization and visibility penalties on you by 1 per rank. Each rank also reduces the maximum immobilization and visibility penalty you can suffer from by 1\.

### **Desert Ghosts**

In the world of shinobi, there is no such thing as hunter and hunted; one is both, at all times. The Juugo Sato are preeminently aware of this. That awareness, and their mentality of never taking their safety for granted, has led to no end of frustration for foreign shinobi trying to gauge the strength and frequency of Suna's patrols.

Type: Ability  
Base Cost: 4  
Scale: 2  
Limit: DEX/20

Effects:  
For every rank you have a \+1 bonus to Survival and Stealth rolls, and anyone attempting to track or search for you has a \-1 penalty to their roll. If you are leading a group with a size of your Survival skill or less (including you), you may make a single Survival roll for all members, and anyone trying to track the group receives a \-1 penalty per rank to their roll. Multiple Sand Foxes may work together, pooling their Survival skills for the maximum size, and using only the highest roll and penalty.

### **Intuition**

There are multiple sayings in Suna about a Sand Fox's intuition. Some are jokes at their expense, often told by Genin. And the clan bears them without comment, because among the jonin those sayings are proverbs.

It's not, despite what some have speculated, anything supernatural. The Juugo Sato can't actually watch every leaf in a forest at once, or hear a feather falling. All they can do, and all they need to do, is be calm, and watch, and listen, and know what about a setting is just a little bit wrong.

Type: Ability  
Cost: 50  
Requires: 20 Awareness, 20 Survival

Effects:  
All enemies are treated as being 1 Stealth category lower than they actually are, to you; this mainly applies for reducing their Stealth bonus when you're looking for them. 

This does allow you to attack an enemy in Stealth 1, though you may do so only with ranged attacks, and then at a \-3 penalty to Accuracy--you're going by intuition, and essentially firing blind. Area-of-effect attacks do not suffer from this Accuracy penalty. Similarly, you are inherently aware of the presence (though not location) of anyone only in Stealth 1-- they can't sneak up on you.

## **Kairaishi**

Not actually a clan at all, Kairaishi is a term reserved for those in Suna who embrace a specific method of fighting: manipulation of weaponized puppets.

Learning to do so takes years of training, and with the exception of a handful of geniuses every few generations takes up almost all of one's free time during their academy years. Most puppeteers learn everything they know being mentored by a master of the art, who will typically take only one student at a time.

One of the greatest assets of puppeteers is their ability to essentially multiply their forces on the battlefield. A skilled puppeteer can control several human-sized puppets at once, potentially tipping the numbers in their side's favor.

### **Kugutsu no Jutsu \- Puppet Technique**

The Kairaishi's signature technique and a unique ninjutsu, this allows the user to extend strands of chakra from their body and attach them to puppets. Using the puppets, they can attack and manipulate them from range while remaining relatively safe themselves. The better the user's control over their chakra, the better they can control puppets by the strands connecting them.

Type: Ninjutsu, Rank E  
Chakra: 10 \+ X  
Upkeep: 2 \+ X  
Speed: 1 \+ X/2 (round down)

Effects:  
You gain control of 1 \+ X puppets which are uncontrolled on the battlefield. At all times, one of these puppets is designated as your primary puppet. You choose this at the start of any combat, and may change your primary puppet by spending 10 AP. Many techniques use this puppet as the main source of your attacks or defenses, your other puppets supporting it, just adding a bonus to your attack. If they were puppets which you haven't worked on (i.e. someone else's) have a \-3 penalty to all actions with them. While controlling puppets, your hands are not free for handseals, using weapons, or so forth. By default (i.e. without any ranks in Puppet Mastery, below) you may only control 1 puppet at a time. You do not have to keep track of puppet IC.

You can use puppets from stealth. However, any doujutsu that can see chakra automatically succeed on a search check while using this jutsu.  
While maintaining this technique's Upkeep you may take the following actions.

Control Puppets: Attack Formation (Speed Variable, AP X)  
1 \+ X puppets will attack, using whatever the primary puppet is equipped with to decide what you have available. The speed of this technique is the speed of the primary puppet's choice of attack. If you spend AP to AP this down, the puppet's attack is also reduced. The attack has a \+1 bonus for every two puppets in the formation. This may be used to cause your puppet to perform any Taijutsu (Unarmed, Combo, or Grapple) you know, as well any Weapon Taijutsu you know which they have the proper weapon for. Doing this requires you to pay a Chakra cost equal to that technique's Stamina cost.

Control Puppets: Defensive Formation (Speed Variable, AP X, Interrupt)  
1 \+ X puppets will move to protect you. You may choose any defense the primary puppet is equipped to do. The speed of this is based on the speed of the defense used. If you spend AP to AP this down, the puppet's defense is also reduced.The defense has a \+1 bonus for every two puppets in the formation.

Control Puppets: Dodge (Speed 2 \+ X / 2, Interrupt, AP 1 \+ X / 2\)  
Up to 1 \+ X puppets dodge a technique. This may be used alongside the user defending themselves (You may dodge too\!).

Control Puppets: Prepare (Speed 5\)  
You prepare yourself to do something involving your puppets. This generates 5 AP, which does count towards your maximum but may only be used in actions taken with Kugutsu no Jutsu. This action cannot have its speed reduced.

Control Puppets: Move (Speed Variable) You may move any number of puppets at once, using no AP. Every 1 AP you do choose to spend increases the Speed of their move action (but not this action, for you) by 2\.

### **Puppet Mastery**

A novice puppet master needs both hands to direct the motions of a single puppet, often using a finger for each joint or something similar. A master learns how to split their chakra threads, and with as little as the twitching of a single digit and modulating of their chakra flows gracefully direct their puppets.

Type: Ability  
Cost: 5  
Scale: 2  
Limit: XP /500, max 9

Effects:  
You may control 1 additional puppet at a time with Kugutsu no Jutsu for each rank in this ability, up to a maximum of 10 (one per finger) with all 9 ranks. In addition, As long as you are only controlling half of the maximum number of puppets, you have a single hand free to do with as you wish, including using hand seals if you have the Single Handed Seals Unique.

### **Kugutsu Henge no Jutsu \- Puppet Transformation Technique**

With this technique you can channel chakra through your puppet to give it your own appearance. This is typically done in conjunction with an actual disguise put on the puppet in case the technique fails, as it suffers from the same limitations at normal Henge.

Type: Ninjutsu, Rank D  
Chakra: 5  
Speed: 8  
Seal Speed: 6

Effects:  
You disguise your puppet to look like you. This has all the limitations of normal Henge, but without any worry of a false impersonation: You know how you look and act to mimic yourself perfectly. Consequently, you have a \+5 to your Espionage roll against people figuring out your puppet isn't you.

Anything that detects normal Henge will also detect this technique, and if the puppet takes damage the technique ends immediately.

### **Kugutsu Kuchiyose no Jutsu \- Puppet Summoning Technique**

Most puppeteers don't carry all of their puppets out at once to give themselves a tactical advantage, instead using this technique to keep them stored in scrolls, to be summoned in battle when needed.

Type: Ninjutsu, Rank D  
Chakra: 5 \+ X\*2 per puppet  
Speed: 5 \+ X\*2 per puppet  
Seal Speed: 6

Effects:  
You summon X amount of puppets you've stored in scrolls ahead of time, which you can then use.

### **Souen: Hitomu Gokuu \- Puppet Performance: Skillful Achievement with a Human Body**

A technique developed amidst the First Shinobi War, this jutsu became highly regarded by puppet master's allies and enemies, as it allows them to continue fighting even after their puppets have been destroyed, gaining a new ally with every enemy defeated.

Type: Ninjutsu, Rank A  
Chakra: 35  
Speed: 10  
Seal Speed: 20  
Range: 20

Effects:  
You gain control of a corpse on the battlefield. If the body has more than 3 Major Wounds, 2 Severe Wounds, or 1 Critical Wound, it is too badly decimated to be of use and can't be used with this jutsu.

The body functions exactly like a normal puppet would, using your CHA in place of their STR, and your DEX in place of its DEX and AGI. Unlike normal puppets, you use the body's normal HP amount to determine Wounds, and once it has received too many wounds, the body is considered destroyed and no longer usable.

Alternatively, you can connect your Chakra Strands to that of a willing target to empower them. While you are connected, you suffer from an Upkeep 15, and the following effects occur:

* The target uses the higher of yours or their bonus to Chakra Exhaustion rolls (not taking into account the penalty from this move's upkeep).  
  * The target can choose to use your chakra instead of theirs, in which case you take the any effects (chakra penalties or lowered fatigue) as a result of chakra exhaustion rolls, instead of them.  
  * The target has access to all jutsu you know, and can use any elemental jutsu that they or you has the appropriate aptitude for.  
  * The target can use theirs or your Ninjutsu Damage Bonus, whichever is higher.  
  * When the target attacks on a simultaneous action with you, you can perform an attack formation action with them using the remainder of your puppets in which the target acts as the main puppet of the formation.  
  * Both the target can you can end the upkeep at any point you wish, severing the connection. Any techniques which were dependent on the connection (like a Doton upkeep move, while the target doesn't have aptitude for Doton) immediately end.  
  * Anything that can target and destroy chakra threads can also do so to disrupt this technique. 

### **Puppets**

The weapon of choice of puppeteers, these range from the size of a small human to that of a large animal. There are no 'standard-issue' puppets, though the village does have a stockpile of old and unused ones which can be borrowed. Puppets are usually custom-built by their user or inherited and modified from that person's mentor.

You have XP/50 Puppet Points (PP). All parts have a cost in PP (admittedly, some as low as 0); the total of all parts used in any single puppet can go up to your max PP. This is not actually a resource, per se, but a measurement of skill. Within your limits, you purchase parts using ryo. 

In the village, puppets can be repaired or have parts swapped out between scenes. When on a mission it takes an IC hour of dedicated work to restore 10% of the HP of a single puppet, due to lacking the proper tools and resources.

Puppets are immune to genjutsu and all status effects other than immobilize and ignite. They take only half damage from ignite. Since you are controlling them, your visibility penalties apply; other status penalties on you do not.

Puppets use your CHA in place of their STR, and your DEX in place of their AGI and DEX. They do not have RES or CHA. They can move (As detailed above) but cannot move more than your CHA in yards from your. Otherwise, puppets receive all your bonuses to accuracy and rolls, such as from abilities and uniques.

Finally, puppets are complicated pieces of equipment. Their biggest weaknesses are their joints and other moving parts. If a puppet is suffering from an immobilization penalty of 6 or higher, it cannot act or be used with any part of Kugutsu no Jutsu.The most basic, and expensive part of the puppet. The frame of a puppet is constructed from chakra-conducive wood, and all the puppets' various parts are anchored to it. Frames are divided into several general categories, described below. Each frame has a PP capacity for action location, for example "Head: 3 PP". This means that you can fit up to 3 PP worth of upgrades in that location, if you're using that frame.

By default, a frame can accommodate one torso, one head, two arms, and one pair of legs. Each arm has its own, separate PP capacity, but legs are outfitted as a pair.

Note: Additional legs increase movement speed by 25% per pair. Every two additional arms gives a \+3 bonus to any roll based on STR, including grapples. Despite the fact legs and arms come in pairs, cosmetically there could be more or less; a centipede puppet might be described as having dozens of legs, even if it only actually had three pairs.

Puppets do not cost money. You may have one puppet, plus one more puppet for each rank in Puppet Mastery.

### **Frame Sizes**

*Small*:

Ranging in size from a medium-sized dog to a human child, these frames have the advantage of not requiring a lot of material and being reasonably forgiving in construction. Unfortunately, this also means they're easily destroyed.

HP: 200  
Head: 3 PP  
Torso: 3 PP  
Arms: 2 PP each  
Legs: 4 PP  
Special: You may exchange two arms for a second pair of legs, but not vice versa. The puppet has a \+2 bonus to Stealth rolls, and \+3 to dodge.

*Medium*:

Generally the size of an adult human, these are the most widely-used and adaptable puppets. They have a balance of strength and speed, and can endure longer battles than more delicate models, while also retaining plenty of mobility.

HP: 400  
Damage Reduction: 10  
Head: 5 PP  
Torso: 6 PP  
Arms: 3 PP each  
Legs: 6 PP  
Special: Medium Puppets allows you to fit on another two arms or one pair of legs.

*Recon*:

Somewhere between a small and medium frame, with light but sturdy materials, this frame is optimized for stealth and reconnaissance puppets.

HP: 250  
Head: 8 PP  
Torso: 3 PP  
Arms: 2 PP each  
Legs: 4 PP  
Special: \+5 Stealth

*Reinforced*:

Using the medium frame as a base, these use stronger and heavier materials, reinforced joints, and armor plates. While these are exceptionally sturdy as a result, it's too compact to allow for the extensive customization most puppeteers enjoy.

HP: 500  
Damage Reduction: 75  
Head: 2 PP  
Torso: 2 PP  
Arms: 1 PP each  
Legs: 2 PP

*Large*:

The biggest and most expensive puppets, these tend to be built with a specific purpose in mind. They have above average durability and great storage space, but can be impractical in certain situations. The smallest of these are easily larger than a large person.

HP: 350  
Head: 5 PP  
Torso: 10 PP  
Arms: 4 PP each  
Legs: 6 PP  
Special: \-5 dodge, \-5 stealth, and \-2 parrying. Large Puppets allow you to add an extra two arms, or pair of legs. You may spend up to 300 extra Ryo this way.

### **Frame Upgrades \- Generic**

Below are upgrades you can apply to your puppet's torso to make it more effective at whatever it is you want its purpose to be. Unless specified otherwise, you can apply these upgrades as many times as you have the PP for. Upgrades here do not count towards the PP capacity of any of the puppet's locations.

*Armored*:

Your puppet is covered with armor plates, or sturdy pieces of wood. This reduces any damage it takes by 5 points, stacking with its existing damage reduction.  
PP: 1

*Increased Capacity:*

You can fit more things in your puppet\! This increases the PP capacity of a single location by 1\.  
PP: 2

*Quiet Joints:*

Your puppet can move without its components clicking together and causing all sorts of noise. This gives a \+3 bonus to Stealth. You may take this twice.

PP: 2

*Sturdy:*

Your puppet is especially durable. You can spend 1 PP to increase its HP by some amount, depending upon its frame size.

Small: \+50  
Medium: \+75  
Recon: \+25  
Reinforced: \+100  
Large: \+75

### **Frame Upgrades \- Head**

*Camera:*

You install a camera inside your puppet's head\! It follows the normal rules for cameras (see Gear, in the Equipment chapter), though its presence is typically not obvious, since it's... you know, inside the puppet's head. You need film for it; see below.  
PP: 3

*Film Reel:*

You install a roll of film in your puppet's head. Goes well with the camera\! A single reel can hold up to ten of these. You can install multiple film reels, if you want to be able to take more than ten pictures.  
PP: 1

*Hidden Weapon (Melee):*

You have a concealed weapon, typically a blade of some sort. This cannot be disarmed, and can be used to attack in grapple. The first time in a battle it's used, it's an automatic surprise attack.  
This weapon is modified to be usable by the puppet; you can't remove it and fight with it yourself. It can be any Small sized Slashing or Piercing weapon from the Equipment chapter of the PHB; the cost of the weapon must be paid.  
PP: 3  
Cost \+Special

*Hidden Weapon (Ranged):*

Your puppet has a weapon launcher inside of its head. It can hold up to twenty kunai, shuriken, or senbon, which must be paid for normally. You can purchase this multiple times, each time adding to the capacity getting a separate launcher for a different type of weapon.  
PP: 1  
\+Special

*Perception:*

By placing small, chakra-conductive components in the head of the puppet the user can see and hear what the puppet sees and hears. This upgrade can be toggled on and off as a Speed 0 action. While using it, you suffer visibility penalties, and make Awareness checks, based on your puppet's location and 'senses' rather than your own. You can only use this for one puppet at a time.  
PP: 2

*Voice Box:*

Using a chakra-based speaker in its head, your puppet can talk\! Specifically, it can transmit your voice, or a distorted and unrecognizable version of it.  
PP: 1

### **Frame Upgrades \- Torso**

*Exploding Torso:*

By placing exploding tags in the body of a puppet, the thing is turned into what is essentially a walking bomb. This allows you to store up to (Chakra Control skill ranks)/5 Exploding Tags inside the puppet. You may detonate them as a Speed 10 action while controlling the puppet. The puppet takes double the full damage, anyone inside or grappling it may choose to block (though not dodge). The range is 20 yards, \+1 per tag after the first, and the damage is the total damage of all the tags used in this. The accuracy penalty for not being able to escape an AoE, however, is halved. You must pay for the exploding tags separately.  
If a puppet loses all its HP after doing this, it cannot be repaired without returning to a village and rebuilding it entirely.  
PP: 3 ; it costs an additional 1 PP per tag, which may be taken from any location  
Cost: \+ Cost of exploding tags

*Hollow Body:*

All puppets are hollow, but this modification creates a spacious, shell-like area inside the torso of the puppet. This is large enough to fit a person and, depending on the design, may have eye holes too look out from. If so, Awareness checks can be made, but at a \-4 penalty.  
Getting into or out of the puppet is a Speed 8 action; it can be locked from the inside. However, while inside you may not use perform handseals (too cramped), attack or be attacked, or control your other puppets.  
A person inside cannot be attacked until the puppet has been destroyed.  
PP: 6

*Reinforced:*

Your puppet is reinforced. No, really. Each application of this increases the puppet's HP by 25\.  
PP: 1

*Trap Body:*

An elaborate arrangement of wires and launches inside a hollowed out torso which, when triggered, fire and wrap around a target, then quickly retract to pull them into the puppet to capture them.  
When the puppet is attacked in melee, this can be declared in place of a defensive action; it's a Speed 10 Interrupt, which costs 5 AP to use (via Chakra Threads). The puppet takes half damage from the attack, and the attacker must then defend against this attack.  
If they fail, they are trapped and locked inside the puppet's Hollow Body; Trap Bodies lock (automatically) from the outside, and cannot be opened from the inside without destroying the puppet. The person inside is limited to basic unarmed attacks against the puppet while inside. This can only be deployed once per battle, after which it needs to be reset.  
PP: 4

### **Frame Upgrades \- Arms**

*Chakra Shield:*

Installed in an arm, these deploy by unfolding umbrella-like wooden spokes and briefly projecting a temporarily solidified shield of chakra. This is a Speed 5 Interrupt, costs 3 AP to use, and requires either a successful parry roll with a \+5 bonus, or a successful Take The Hit roll vs the accuracy of the technique when used. If used to defend the puppet, it's used alongside a Control Puppets: Dodge, and instead of adding Speed it just costs 5 AP.  
The shield has (CHA\*5) as HP that is reduced when it absorbs damage. If this stops an attack entirely, subtract half that attack's damage from the Shield’s HP; that's how much HP the shield has remaining for future uses. If an attack does more damage than the shield's remaining HP, the puppet takes any carryover, and the shield is unusable for the rest of the battle.  
If this blocks all damage from a technique, it will stop any other effects (such as immobilization or ignite). Targeted or AoE techniques that deal no damage instead have their effects halved should the Chakra Shield be successfully deployed in time. Obviously, environmental effect techniques are entirely unaffected by the Shield and suffer no reductions.  
You can only take One Chakra Shield per Puppet.  
PP: 3

*Equipped Weapon:*

Your puppet has a weapon it can use in its arm. This can be any weapon with a Stamina cost of 10 or less; you may increase the maximum Stamina cost by 5, by increasing the PP cost by 1\. The puppet increases any Accuracy bonuses on the weapon, by 2\. It may dual-wield only (Dual) weapons, and those only at your level of the Dual Wielding ability. You must pay for the weapon used. To use a two-handed weapon, this must be purchased for both arms which will be using that weapon. The cost of the weapon itself only has to be paid for once.  
PP: 1 \- 4  
Cost: \+Weapon's cost

*Flamethrower:*

A contraption which sprays a mist or stream of some combustible substance and ignites it with chakra on contact with oxygen. This enables the puppet to, as the name suggests, project powerful gouts of flame.  
This is a Speed 14 action for the puppet. In addition to doing (CHA/8)d10 damage, this inflicts Burns 6 and Ignite 5 if the target fails a status roll, using your Chakra Control.  
PP: 1 for the mechanism, 1 per 2 uses

*Glider:*

Special, folding wings installed inside the arms of your puppet, this can extend and retract as necessary. To be useful you must install this upgrade in both arms of a pair. This upgrade halves the puppet's physical damage with those arms.  
The puppet can fly. An airborne puppet may not carry people (via Hollow Body). A flying puppet is immune to any effects reliant upon contact with the ground (such as some immobilization penalties) and cannot be targeted by melee range techniques unless it made a melee-range attack in the past 25 IC.  
PP: 2

*Grapple Arm:*

Your puppet can fire off its hand, with a high tensile chakra wire attaching it back to the arm. This allows your puppet to initiate a Grapple at a distance as a Speed 10 action. From there it can, as a separate Speed 6 action, draw itself to the person in question. From there it may perform any Grapple jutsu you know when you make it attack.  
PP: 2

*Hidden Weapon:*

This is an upgrade to a weapon the puppet is already equipped with. That weapon is concealed inside the puppet's arm and spring-loaded. The first time it's used in a battle it is automatically a Surprise Attack. This cannot be done with a Large weapon. After this upgrade, the weapon cannot be disarmed.  
PP: 2

### **Frame Upgrades \- Legs**

*Hidden Weapon:*

By hiding a weapon inside the puppet's leg, it allows the puppet to, well, attack with that weapon. Weapons of less than Large size may be installed. Weapons used may have a Stamina cost of up to 10, \+5 per extra PP spent on this upgrade.  
The first time the weapon is used in a battle, it is an automatic Surprise Attack. This uses the weapon's damage, speed, and so forth. You must pay for the weapon separately from this upgrade.  
Cost: 2 \- 4 PP  
Cost: \+Weapon's cost

*Mobile Legs:*

Special legs designed to go over any terrain, be it rocks, water, ice, or even up cliffs. These legs reduce immobilization penalties based on the condition of the ground by 1; you can stack this benefit by giving this upgrade to multiple pairs of legs. These legs can also use Water Walking and Wall Walking, if you have those abilities.  
PP: 3

*Tail:*

Your puppet replaces its legs with a tail\! This reduces its movement speed by 25% (or, if the puppet still has another pair of legs, the pair converted into a tail just doesn't provide a 25% increase in movement speed) but reduces immobilization penalties based on the condition of the ground by 2, and all other immobilization penalties by 1\.  
Outfitting multiple pairs of legs with this upgrade stacks its effects by improving the size and quality of the tail.  
This upgrade gives your puppet a \+4 bonus to grapple rolls; that benefit does not stack if multiple pairs of legs have this.  
The tail is prehensile, and may grip and grab things, and counts as a single limb in a grapple. PP: 3

## **Monkasei**

The Monkasei lineage--they haven't organized themselves into a proper clan, despite gentle prodding from the village to do so--is viewed in generally good light by the people of Sand.

Much of that comes from the fact that every member who displays their kekkei genkai is directly descended from the First, Third, or Fourth Kazekage; the trio weren't directly related, but most likely had a common ancestor, since they possessed an identical, or nearly identical, bloodline. It also helps that the Monkasei, as a general rule, are fairly modest about their bloodline and heritage.

That advanced bloodline is the ability to create magnetic chakra, and seems to have actually gotten stronger in recent generations; the First Kazekage was hailed as the strongest Kazekage his village had ever seen, rivalled only by the Fifth, but his control of magnetic chakra was limited only to iron dust; he did not possess an actual magnetic jutsu.

On the other hand, that may simply be a result of the passage of time. He may well have been the first of his kind, and he had nobody's mistakes and successes to learn from. Even if the bloodline hasn't grown more powerful, it has become more refined, and while the number of inheritors is fairly small, they're flourishing and growing in number.

**Monkasei start with 1 less Unique Point and begin with the Elemental Aptitude for Lightning and Wind. They also have Elemental Affinity: Jiton, which includes Raiton and Fuuton.**

### **Jiton \- Magnetism Release**

What sets the Monkasei bloodline apart from its peers is their advanced chakra nature. Though commonly referred to as 'magnetic' chakra, there's more to it than that: even nonmagnetic metals can be affected by their abilities. Most Monkasei realize their powers well before they can use ninjutsu, or sometimes even mold chakra at all, when they start intuitively dragging metal objects to them. 

Any Fuuton or Doton Technique can be converted into a Jiton technique, with the following effects:

* \+5 Chakra cost  
  * When you transform a Raiton or Doton technique into a Jiton technique, you must pick whether it's Positively Charged Jiton, or Negatively Charged Jiton. They always count as Severity 1 of the appropriate charge  
  * Raiton gives Immob of the same Severity and Duration rather than Paralysis.  
  * All Jiton non-interrupt techniques have their base Speed increased by 1 per rank of Jutsu (1 for E, 3 for C, etc.). Thus, a Jiton Retsudotensho would be treated as a Speed 25 action for all purposes (including its minimum Speed after reductions), rather than 22\.  
  * All Jiton techniques have their Base Speed reduced by double the total severity of their target's Magnetize Charges and the technique's if it is of the opposite Charge, up to a max of Base Speed 4\. or have it increased by the same amount if the Charges are similar. They still use the original Base Speed (After the normal Jiton Speed Increase) for damage calculations. For example, if you were using a Positively Charged Doki Kantsuu against a target that has Negative Charge 2, the total Base Speed reduction is 6, putting the jutsu down to speed 10 (After the base increase from Jiton) but are treated as if it’s still Speed 16 for damage multiplication.  
  * All Jiton techniques have their Chakra cost reduced by twice the total Charge Severity of the jutsu and target if they are opposites. And increased by the same amount if they are similar.  
  * If a Jiton jutsu has no viable targets within its range, or if it isn’t a targeted jutsu. Then you may still pick somebody with Magnetize within CHA range and use them to determine Speed and Chakra cost reductions or increases of the Jutsu.  
  * If a Jiton technique is used against multiple targets or has an a Radius that reaches several targets with different Severities and Charges, then use the highest Severity to determine what Charge bonuses and penalties apply. If two or more of the Highest severity targets have the same severity but in different Charges, then pairs of opposites cancel each other out until one dominant Charge is left, or there are no more Charges and the Jutsu gains no penalties or bonuses. This does not actually remove the Charges from the targets, and any increases or decrease to the Charge after the attack lands still apply.  
  * Jiton is strong against Doton and Suiton, but weak against Katon.

### **Magnetize**

Magnetize is, in truth, two different Status Effects, Positive Charge and Negative Charge, both of which represent the target having become Magnetized. There is no difference between the Positive and Negative charges of Magnetize except in how the two charges interact with each other. If a target is hit by a Positive or Negative Jiiton jutsu they gain a charge of the appropriate type. 

A Magnetized target has their charge increase by 1 severity if a jutsu of the same charge strikes them. For example, Someone with Positive Magnetize 1 who's hit by a Positive Charge Jiiton technique is elevated to Positive Magnetize 2\. However, if they are struck by a Jiiton technique of the opposite Charge, then their Charge will decrease by 1 severity as one Charge cancels the other, up to possibly 0, becoming "Neutral" and losing the Magnetize Status Effect Entirely.

The Severity of Positive and Negative Charges can only go up to a maximum of 3\. 

If you attack a Magnetized target with Jiiton technique of the opposite Charge as theirs, then you gain a bonus to your Accuracy according to the total severity of each Charge. A Positive Charge 2 target attacked by a Negative Charge 1 Jiiton attack gives a \+3 to ACC. However, an attack of the same Charge provides a penalty equal to the total severity of both charges as the two Positive or Negative Charges repel each other.

Magnetize disappears completely an hour after the last time it was applied.

### **Noishi O Kasu \- Impose Thy Will**

The most fundamental yet important technique available to the Monkasei, and the gateway to what has made them birth so many Kazekages. The Monkasei simply infuses his potent Chakra Nature into other objects through touch. Once a talented Monkasei has mastered the basics then they can even channel their chakra through themselves, becoming a manifestation of their Chakra Nature and enhancing their Jiton techniques even further.

Type: Jiton Ninjutsu, Rank D  
Chakra: 12  
Speed: 10  
Seal Speed: 8

Effects: You can magnetize up to CHA/2 weapons in your possession and/or within CHA/4 range that aren’t occupied, giving them a Negative or Positive Charge of Severity 1\. If they are used in some form of an attack against somebody with the Magnetize Status Effect, then they will gain the appropriate ACC bonus or Penalty depending on the charge. They, however, do not gain other effects such as the Speed Reduction or Increase. After they are used in an attack, or after 20 ICs pass, the Charge disappears off the weapons. This jutsu cannot be used on an already magnetized weapon to increase the Severity of its Charge. Nor on Ranged Weapons created by Fuuton who already start with a Charge.

Alternatively, you can increase the Chakra Cost by \+10, speed by \+5, and apply an Upkeep of 4 to make yourself Magnetized. Gaining a Positive or Negative Charge of Severity 1\. This has two effects. Whenever somebody who is magnetized attacks you, they gain an ACC bonus or penalty based on normal Magnetization interactions. And half of the typical Speed Reduction or Increase. And if they strike you, their Charge increases or decreases based on the Charge they had or if they were neutral. In addition, all of your Jiton attacks gain that Charge on top of the base Charge they have. Either increasing their Charge to Severity 2, which also increases how much the target’s Charge changes. Or Canceling the technique’s Charge. If the Charge is canceled, then the Jiton technique gains no benefits or drawbacks from Magnetise, nor does it increase or decrease the Charges of a target.

### **Denji Yuusei \- Electromagnetic Dominance**

Your manipulation of magnetic chakra has lots of potential uses\! All of the following have a Chakra 10 cost, and are considered to be E-Ranked Jiton Ninjutsu effects:

* When throwing weapons (either as part of a Jutsu or as a Multi-Throw) you may use CHA/8 in place of DEX/10 to determine how many you can throw. And you may use your NDB instead of PDB. This does NOT gain any bonuses or penalties based on the Magnetize of the target unless the thrown weapons had a Charge of their own.  
* You may also disarm an opponent's held metal weapon as a Speed 10 action, rolling 1d20+CHA/8 against their 1d20+STR/10, once again receiving Magnetize bonuses or penalties to ACC. If successful, you may throw the weapon up to CHA/4 yards in any direction, or bring it to yourself (and, if you wish, wield it).  
* You can retrieve, as a Speed 4 action, any discarded metal weapons or used projectiles within CHA/2 yards, bringing them to yourself.

### **Mujona Kaiho \- Merciless World Order**

By no means the most powerful of a Monkasei's abilities, this is still one of the most visually impressive. You project your magnetic chakra out across the battlefield, and use it to seize control of any discarded metal weapons--kunai, shurikens, even swords. Using that control, you're able to attack with impunity without having to make a single motion.

Type: Jiton Ninjutsu, Rank C  
Chakra: 10  
Upkeep: 2  
Speed: 4

Effects:  
While this is maintained you may take a Speed 0 action to spend AP to make any number of ranged attacks with any metallic weapons present and not being held on the battlefield within a range of CHA/2. 

This costs 1 AP per 2 Speed it would normally cost to attack with the weapon; the weapon uses its base Speed for damage purposes. This uses your CHA instead of DEX for Accuracy, your ninjutsu damage bonus in place of your physical damage bonus for multiplying by Speed to determine damage, and replaces the normal Stamina cost of the attack with an equivalent Chakra cost. For fuuma shuriken and large star shuriken, the damage dice use your CHA instead of your STR.

These weapons don't benefit from weapon-specific abilities.

Attacks made with Merciless World Order use your ninjutsu ACC at \-3 but they then have double the bonus/penalty to their ACC from the target’s positive or negative charge, none of the other Jiton effects (such as applying more Magnetize) apply. Each weapon can only be used once in the same IC, and there is a 10 IC cooldown between uses of this ability, but you may use this ability to Multi-Throw (without the benefits from any weapon specific abilities).

Attacks which do more damage based on how much they hit, such as Fuuma and Large Shuriken, do not get these bonuses.

Defenses declared against attacks from Merciless World Order do not advance initiative count, but the defense still needs to be speed legal in order to be used.

## **Sabechi**

When Sunagakure initially organized itself into a formal village of Ninja, the Sabechi were the tribe most resistant to allying themselves with those who had been their rivals for generations. They fought against change and the alliances that were being made, relying upon nature for their survival against what quickly became a much larger force.

In doing so, they resorted to extreme measures. While no Sabechi ever confirmed as much, it is suspected that they tried all manners of profane rituals and struck bargains with the most dangerous and amoral of the species to be found within Sunagakure, which is how they began to produce a poison from their own blood.

Eventually they did assimilate into the village, sufficiently impressed by the collective force of the tribes. For a long time they voluntarily segregated themselves, but over time they formed bonds with the Henzaki and the Hitori in particular, impressed by the former's talents and admiring the Hitori's spirit. The three clans, often teamed together, form an odd balance of sorts; a Sabechi's dark humor, a Henzaki's withdrawn neutrality, and a Hitori's overzealous enthusiasm.

Members of the clan are not a very vocal sort, with a sense of humor that is often classified as 'twisted'. While well mannered, most Sabechi have a sense of wit which invariably carries undertones not fully understood by those they converse with until well after they've spoken, making those that meet them frequently question just what they meant.

You gain 5+XP/200 ranks in Toxicology for free (Essentially, you’ll always be at base cap, without accounting for Uniques), this cannot raise you above your cap.

### **Rustblood**

The blood of a Sabechi is poisonous.  Aside from minor conveniences, like it being harder to give them transfusions and the sabechi as a whole being ineligible for blood donations, it can also be used in combat as a very potent toxin.

Poison: 2  
Duration: 200 \+ (Toxicology Ranks \* 10\)

Effects:  
The most common method of using a Sabechi's Rustblood is by coating weapons with it, which can be done as a Speed 5 action. his action will inflict ((RES/20) \* (RES/20))\*2 Damage to the Sabechi and grants them 1 \+ (Toxicology Ranks/5) doses worth of poison to a melee weapon. Rustblood cannot be applied to Ranged Weapons, mostly because the small surface level cannot hold enough of the Sabechi’s Rustblood to infect somebody.

* The poison is considered a Contact poison, but it can be applied to any weapon type.  
  * A toxicology roll and a resistance roll are required for the poison to take effect. Rustblood has a bonus of (RES/20) to its toxicology roll.  
  * The poisonous nature of their blood is dependent on the unique physiology of the Sabechi, so it will break down rapidly outside of their body. This prevents it from being stored for any significant amount of time and from being used to lace food or drinks. It also means that their poison cannot be converted into a Poison Smoke Bomb through the Aerosolized Poisons ability.  
  * Effects that reduce the severity of poisons or otherwise negate or replace the effects of poisons like the Salamander Summon and Henzaki’s Homeostasis Ability don't remove or prevent the effects of Rustblood or its Mutation Chemicals.  
  * Once someone is infected with Rustblood, they can have mutation chemicals applied to them in order to add effects to the poison. These effects only apply to the current version of Rustblood they are affected by, and as such, someone can only be affected by one rendition of Rustblood at any time.  
  * Rustblood’s duration is not reduced by partial success against resistance. It lasts for its full duration, no matter how much or little it beats your opponent’s toxicology roll.

### **Mutation Chemicals**

Any time a Sabechi could use their Rustblood (Either by applying it to a weapon or applying it directly to an opponent through the use of a predatory protrusion), they may pay ((RES/20)\*(RES/20))+((RES/20)\*(RES/20)) vitality to instead apply a mutation chemical to a Rustblood Poison, adding effects to it. They must specify at the time they apply the mutation chemical which mutation chemical it is.

You get (RES/20) as a bonus to toxicology rolls to apply a Mutation Chemicals and Rustblood.

**Inflammant:**  
The Pathogen stimulates an allergic reaction within the victim’s immune system, causing the victim’s body to attack itself to try and get rid of it, causing irritation and inflammation at the site. It inflicts a Burn Status of 2, or increases an existing Status by 2\.

**Convulsing Nodes:**  
The Pathogen seeps into the victim’s meridians. The physical vessels that transfer their spiritual energies. Causing them to convulse, completely unwinding the precise flow of chakra needed for the victim to operate. This creates an overbearing sense that saps away at your very soul. It inflicts a special “Nodes” status of 2, or increases an existing status by 2\.  
“Nodes” has the same effects as Burn, but penalizes CE rolls instead.

**Muscle Necrosis**  
The Pathogen infects the musculature of the victim, degrading the soft-tissue muscle fibers until they snap. Both causing intense pain and crippling the victim’s ability to put any meaningful force behind their strikes. This inflicts a \-0.3 to PDB per application.

**Sapping Corruption**  
The Pathogen attacks the very spiritual energy that forms the soul, causing the victim’s chakra reserves to decrease as they have to utilize more and more of it to battle off the corruption to their spirit. This inflicts a \-0.3 to NDB per application.

**Burning Receptors**  
The Pathogen causes a temporary overload of the nerves, subjugating the body to a shock so painful that stops proper brain function for a few moments. Something that can be deadly in the midst of combat, where every second counts. The victim’s nervous system only becomes more susceptible with every dosage. This inflicts Stun 3, which increases by 1 for every application with the fight, becoming stun 4 on the second application, stun 5 on the third, so on and so on.

**Keratitis Bloom:**  
The Pathogen penetrates its way into the clear, frontal layer of the cornea. Infecting large swathes of the specialized nerves of the eyes and hardening the deceased cells until they become nothing but distracting, painful lines and dots within the victim's vision. This inflicts a visibility penalty of 1 per application, up to a cap of RES/20.

**Osteonecrosis:**  
The Pathogen practically begins to rot the structural bone cells and joints which hold the victim's weight, weakening them until they can barely move themselves. it inflicts a Immobilization 1 per application, up to a cap of RES/20.

**Virulent:**  
Your poison becomes increasingly toxic to others, increasing its Severity by 1 per application, up to a total cap of 1 \+ your RES/30.

### **Mithridatism**

Constant exposure to the Sabechi’s own venom eventually has their bodies produce antibodies to a variety of poisons, enabling them to quickly shrug off even the nastiest of toxins.

\- Type: Ability  
\- Base Cost: 3  
\- Scale: 0  
\- Limit: RES/20+1

Effects: You reduce the severity of any Poison you suffer from by 1 per rank. If the severity is reduced to 0, you ignore any secondary effects the poison had as well. This applies to all poisons except for, ironically enough, other Sabechi’s Rustblood poisons.

### **Predatory Protrusions**

Every Sabechi has a way to deliver their poison naturally, without the aid of weapons—such is the nature of their bloodline. As their skill expands and chakra develops, it’s not unheard of for a Sabechi to begin manifesting other mutations.

You choose one of the following mutations below during character creation, a second at 1000 XP, and a third at 2500 XP. You can only ever get up to three Predatory Protrusions on one Sabechi character.

#### **Stinger**

The most obvious of all the mutations and the signature feature of the clan, a Sabechi's stinger is far more potent than a scorpion's, even though they look about the same. It's much longer than it looks, able to extend over the Sabechi's shoulder or around their side to strike those in front of them.

Stinger \[Piercing, Size Variable\]  
Stamina: Special  
Damage: Special  
Speed: Special

Effects:  You have a flexible tail with a curved tip that counts as a Melee Weapon, it does not require hands to use and cannot be disarmed. You can take the Weapon Focus ability for it. You can attack with the Stinger in a Clinch or Pin and if you do so you gain a \+3 acc to its use, and can make automatic called shots at no penalty. If you hit within a Clinch, you can choose to increase the stamina cost of the attack by 10, if you do so, then the stinger will latch onto the unfortunate victim and begin pumping them full of venom. Every 10 ICs that pass while a pin is maintained, the victim receives a dose of Rustblood or a Mutation Chemical of your choosing.

If you deal damage with this weapon, you can inflict a dose of your Rustblood or Mutation Chemical, you do not need to declare this in advance, you can decide what poison to use once you know you have dealt damage, but you have to otherwise pay any normal costs for it.

In addition, not all stingers are of the same shape and size, some are a swift and lithe tail that can flick at the enemy at terrifying speeds. And others are brutish, hairy arachnian appendages that dissuade any would-be enemy just by size alone. When picking this protrusion, you must also pick the size of your stinger. This will determine the die size, stamina cost, and speed of the stinger as well as the jutsus it’s capable of performing and abilities it has access to.

\-Small: STR/10D8, Stamina: 10, Speed: 8, the stinger is capable of using the weapon taijutsu “Chain Serpent” without meeting its qualifications.

\-Medium: STR/10D10, Stamina: 12, Speed: 10, the stinger is capable of using the weapon taijutsu “Vital Strike” without meeting its qualifications.

\-Large: STR/8D12, Stamina 15, Speed: 12, the stinger is capable of using the weapon taijutsu “Rotation Strike” without meeting its qualifications.

**Kyabitēshon \- Cavitation**

When you impale somebody with that third leg of yours, you’re not just stabbing a hole into them, your strike generates cavities into the bodies of their poor victims. Hollow spaces where there was once flesh and other things that kept them alive, but are no more. Just be sure to practice safe penetration.

Stamina: As Weapon \+15  
Damage: As Weapon  
Speed: As Weapon \+10  
Requires: Large, Medium  
Effects:

When you apply a wound, you apply a second wound of the same severity and in the same location.

**Shin no Hasami \- True Pincer**

Most Sabechi don’t actually have their stinger out in the open, they wear loose fitting and baggy clothes to keep it hidden from sight. And then, during a fight, they feint a punch or kick only to have the stinger slip out through the sleeve of their shirt or pants to nail the poor unsuspecting fool that didn’t know what they were up again. Particularly savage or uncaring Sabechi even have the stinger simply tear through the fabric of their clothes. Even those who know of the Sabechi’s nature beforehand find it impossible to read exactly which normal strike will turn into a crippling stab of the demented clan’s stinger.

Weapon Taijutsu, C-Rank  
Stamina: As Weapon \+5  
Damage: As Weapon  
Speed: As Weapon  
Requires: Small, Medium

Effects:

If your stinger is hidden before combat begins, your attack will become an automatic Sneak Attack. This can only be used once per 50 ICs.

#### **Quills**

While not true ‘needles’, some Sabechi actually have the ability to straighten the hairs on their head, which tend to be much thicker than normal hair, enough so to inject trivial amounts of their poison. When used in groups, however, it can be quite deadly.

Quill \[Piercing, Thrown\]  
Stamina: 5  
Damage: 2d6  
Range: 5+STR/5  
Speed: 10

Effects:  
Quills are a Ranged weapon. You can throw a single Quill, using the above stats, or throw multiple at once, in which case you treat it as a standard Multi Throw. If you use at least 5 Quills, you can deliver a dose of your poison or a mutation chemical with them. Plus an extra dose for every 5 extra quills after that. You must decide what poison or mutation chemical to use and pay ((RES/20)\*(RES/20))\*2  for it before making the attack. If you have the weapon focus ability for Senbon, it applies to Quills too.

Any ability that would apply to Senbon applies to Quills.

#### **Saliva**

Your saliva is poisonous in addition to your blood, which while it tends to hamper relationships in a lethal way, does give you another way in which to utilize your body’s toxicity. Those that have it swear by its usefulness.

General Ninjutsu, E-Rank  
Chakra: 12  
Damage: (CHA/10)d10  
Range: 10  
Area: Special  
Speed: 8  
Tags: Energy, Projectile

Effects:  
You can apply a dose of your poison or one of your mutation chemicals with this attack, by spitting on them a caustic solution that eats away at the target. This follows all rules for normal Ninjutsu. By paying for two doses instead of one, you can make this attack Area 10, this must be declared before using the attack and adds the AoE Tag to the attack. Whether it hits the target or not, the saliva will cover the area afterwards.

Anybody that stands within the area for 10 IC will receive a dose of the poison or mutation chemical. And will continue to receive another dose of these effects for every 10 IC thereafter that they stand within the area. This does not bear any extra costs to you.

#### **Oily Skin**

Frequently mistaken for sweat by their enemies in battle, Sabechi with this mutation tend to enjoy trading blows with their opponents, crippling them as the fight goes on.

Stamina: 5  
Upkeep: 2  
Speed: 10

Effects:  
When you activate this mutation, you specify either your poison or a mutation chemical, and suffer (RES/20)\*(RES/20) damage for its use. Thereafter, you deliver a dose of your poison or mutation chemical to anyone who strikes you with an unarmed attack, requiring the normal Resistance roll to prevent.

Additionally, your unarmed attacks will apply (this is not optional) a dose of your poison to any target that you inflict any damage to and is not currently suffering from your poison. Also, if you successfully place your opponent in a grapple (or are grappled by them), this will apply one dose of poison to them. An additional dose of your poison will then be applied every 20IC you remain in a grapple.

A new dose of poison is automatically applied to your skin (and therefore, deducted from your Vit/HP) every time you poison someone. This can knock you unconscious, but will not reduce your HP below 0 (and will shut off, if the cost can’t be paid). As a Speed 5 action while you maintain the upkeep, you can change poison to a mutation chemical, or a mutation chemical to another mutation chemical.

This Protrusion is incompatible with “Carapace”, if you take Oily Skin, you cannot take that mutation. And vice versa.

#### **Carapace**

Plates of tough and flexible chitin grow over multiple parts of your body, giving you the appearance of a true Arachnid. While this makes you more of a monster than other mutations, that’s hardly a sacrifice for the Sabechi when the reward is higher chances of survival.

Gain Damage Reduction of RES/5.

Incompatible with Oily Skin.

## **Hakubai**

**Hakubai starts with the Elemental Aptitude and Elemental Affinity for Suiton.**

### **Vitiligo Hydration**

It is well known to those outside the clan that the Hakubai have some manner of incurable skin disease which causes some part of their skin to produce an unnaturally high amount of melanin, and others to produce none at all. Leading to blotches of unnaturally jet black or bleached white pigmentations to cover the Hakubai's body. What is less known is that the always resourceful and innovative Hakubai have genetically engineered a manner to utilize this anomalous nature of their body. Through the use of secret medical and sealing techniques, and their natural affinities, the Hakubai have turned these patches of their skin into a substance that is able to store and hold a deceptively large volume of water, which they use both for their unique, medical arts, for the combat situations that the Hakubai often find themselves in. They need to keep a close eye on their test subjects, after all...

Cost: 2  
Scale: 2  
Limit: 1+RES/20

Effects: Outside of combat, you can store up 3 Gallons of Water per rank in this Ability by absorbing it into your body. Only you can use these gallons. And when they are used, they are gone just like normal Gallons. Many Hakubai prefer to use this to transport the water they need for their techniques in place of an actual container. Though nothing is stopping you from using both methods to enter a fight fully prepared.

### **Ekitai Kurage \- Liquid Jellyfish**

A bit redundant of a name considering all jellyfish are already like, 99% water... But\! These ones are special in that they're 100% water\! And they're not really jellyfish so much as Suiton parasites that connect the host to the Hakubai and allow the latter to perform on the former many kinds of Medical Jutsus, both beneficial and harmful, from a far distance. Without the need of ever touching them.

Type: C Rank \- Suiton Ninjutsu  
Chakra: 15  
Upkeep: 1  
Range: Touch  
Speed: 8  
Seal Speed: 11  
Gallons Requirement: 5  
Requires: 15 Ranks in Medicine

Effects: You count as Touching any individual that has one of these jellyfish attached to their body for the purpose of any Medical Ninjutsu that requires Touch. And automatically hit with any such Technique. Any targets that wish to resist an application of one of your Medical Ninjutsus can instead roll Resistance vs your CC.

Furthermore, you may spend Gallons of Water in the battlefield or stored inside of your body to lower the Chakra cost of Medical Ninjutsu whenever you perform them through a jellyfish, lowering them by a ratio of 1 Chakra Cost reduction per 1 Gallon spent this way. Up to a maximum of half of the original Chakra Cost.

### **Katsuryoku Sokushin No Jutsu \- Vitality Hastening Technique**

(Flavor Text)

Type: C Rank \- Medical Ninjutsu  
Chakra: 28  
Range: Touch  
Speed: 10  
Seal Speed: 18

Effects: This lasts for (Chakra Control Ranks \+ Medicine Ranks) ICs. You supercharge the target's circulatory system, allowing any chemicals going through their body to run their course much faster. Halve the Duration of any Poisons or Drug the target is suffering from. For Poisons, double the Severity. And for Drugs, double all effects.

### **Katsuryoku No Shōmō No Jutsu \- Vitality Draining Technique**

(flavor text)

Type: B Rank \- Medical Ninjutsu  
Chakra: 40  
Range: Special  
Speed: 18  
Seal Speed: 22  
Requires: "Liquid Jellyfish" on the target, 20 Ranks of Chakra Control.

Effects: This lasts for (Chakra Control Ranks \+ Medicine Ranks) ICs. And may be resisted through a Resistance vs CC roll. If the target fails, they begin losing (Chakra Control/10) Vitality every IC (This cannot reduce HP). And for every Vitality lost this way, every other person with a Liquid Jellyfish parasite attached to them gains an equal amount of Vitality.

### **Drug Maker**

(Flavor text)

Cost: 2  
Scale: 2  
Limit: XP/1000, max of 3

Effects: When you first buy this Ability, you gain (Medicine Ranks/5) Chemistry points. Every subsequent rank in this Ability lowers the divisor by 1, so it becomes "/4" then "/3".

You can spend a downtime action synthesizing a batch of 1 dose of a Drug by combining effects from the list of Chemicals listed below, in the same way that Poisons are made (Read the Poison Brewing section). Chemical effects may be taken more than once. Each Chemical has a Chemistry Point cost, a Ryo Cost, a Synthesis TN, and a Scale for the TN that increases it based on how many times that specific Chemical is taken past the first time. After choosing all the Chemicals to be combined into your Drug, up to a max Chemistry Cost of your Chemistry Points, combine their Synthesis TNs. This is the Total TN that you must reach by rolling Medicine, which you can roll only once per Downtime action, carrying over your previous roll's result for the next Downtime action until you have reached that TN, upon which you are considered to have successfully synthesized that batch of a Drug, and may now use it.

Each Drug applied has a Duration of 30 \+ (Medicine Ranks), and once the Duration passes, all the benefits fade away.

### **High Pressure Syringe (Small, Throwing, Piercing)**

Specially made syringes made of two compartments, first part is a small cannister of pressurized air, and connected to it, is the actual tube which is capable of holding 1 Dose of any given Drug or Poison. When a Syringe pierces flesh, the fragile lid on the gas cannister breaks, causing any Drug or Poison in the Syringe to be automatically, and forcefully injected. The Hakubai train their entire life to not only use these devices in medical circumstances, but in actual combat as well. Before any battle, mission, or operation, the Hakubai can fill up each Syringe with a single dose of a Drug or Poison, saving the need to Apply them during live combat.

Stamina: 5  
Damage: 1d4  
Range: 5+STR/4  
Cost: 2000  
Special: Syringes count as Senbon for any applicable Abilities, Uniques, or Jutsus. And targets struck by a Syringe have a \-3 penalty to Resist any Drug or Poison injected by the Syringe. Anybody that isn't a Hakubai which attempts to use these Syringes incurs a \-6 Accuracy penalty.

### **Spray Canister**

A highly pressurized gas canister with a nozzle, and a button that controls said nozzle. The canister is able to hold up to 3 doses of any single Drug or Aerosolized poison. Though all three doses must be of the same type of Drug or Poison, you cannot mix and match. When the button is pressed, as a Speed 4 Action, it is able to release a very large cloud of any substance in the can which covers anything within a 3x3 area in front of the user. This uses up a single dose. Anybody within the cloud receives the effects of the Drug or Poison that was stored in the canister. But their duration is reduced by 10 ICs due to the distilled nature of the clouds released.

Cost: Ryo\*3

### **Vial**

The basic container for any Drug synthesized by the Hakubai. Each vial can hold 3 doses of any given Drug, so long as all doses are of the same Drug. You can drink from it as a Speed 6 Action to receive the effects of 1 Dose of any Drug contained within, consuming said Dose.

Cost: Free

### **Batch Maker:**

Limit: Medicine/5

Effects: By increasing the cost and TN by 25% you may make 1 extra Dose of the same Drug. You can do this up to your rank in this Ability whenever you synthesize a Batch stacking additively.

### **Pill Maker**

You can make highly concentrated pills that have stronger effects, but are more expensive and harder to make.

Cost: 15  
Scale: 0  
Limit: 1

Effects: When you finish synthesizing a Drug, you can choose to turn a single Dose into a Pill. Paying the appropriate cost. However, you become unable to apply the Batch Maker Ability to that Batch, meaning you gain that Pill as your only Dose for that Downtime Action.

### **Pill**

A highly concentrated form of a given Drug. When swallowed as a Speed 5 Action, you gain the effects of the Drug as normal, but they last twice as long. Requires the Pill Maker Ability.

Cost: Ryo\*2
