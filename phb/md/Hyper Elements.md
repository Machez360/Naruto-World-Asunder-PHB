## **Introduction**

The Hyper Elements are a unique, specialized version of their base elements, that only someone with a natural connection to the element, rather than a learned, may choose to try to develop. Even with natural talent, doing so always takes time, effort, and experimentation-and is usually impossible without a good teacher even for the best of shinobi.

These elements, paired with their base element, are as follows:

* Fire\>Blaze  
* Water\>Abyss  
* Air\>Tempest  
* Lightning\>Plasma  
* Earth\>Crystal

Each individual hyper element unlock costs 1 talent point, and you may not unlock the element unless you have an Affinity for it-aptitude does not count, for these purposes.

In addition, each of these Jutsu may be used to modify weapon creation Jutsu, unlike Para Elementals.

\<Abyss\>  
Abyssal weaponry increases your target's stamina penalty by 1 if they minor, inflict suffocation 1 if they major, 2 if they severe, and 3 if they crit.

\<Blaze\>  
Whenever someone is struck by your weapon, and at least minored, they receive the Blaze debuff (explained below) equal to half its number of rolled dice \+1.

\<Crystal\>  
The weapons you create increase your PDB by your full NDB instead of half, and any stun these weapons would usually cause is instead changed to Bleed. Attacks by this weapon add to the Crystal debuff (explained below).

\<Tempest\>  
Thrown Weapons apply an Area Effect equal to one fourth of the Distance they cover between the user and where they land. And Targets hit by the Thrown Weapons suffer a Knockback effect equal to that same Area Size.

\<Plasma\>  
Plasma weaponry takes the full Oxidation Chakra cost increase on its cost, and half that on its Stamina cost for any attacks made with it. Generally, this will round down, but in the case of the Initial Stam cost (usually 5, until it rises above 5 in cost increase) it will be \+3 baseline. In addition, it does half as much extra Oxidation damage as normal Raiton on hit. (Ex: if Oxidation damage bonus is 20%, Plasma weaponry would do 10%).

## **Blaze Release**

Blaze is the never ending black flame of the Amaterasu. Or at least, an approximation of it. Katon users have been trying to recreate the black flame of the Amaterasu for years now, with very limited success. Whilst the results of this research doesn’t allow the user to create truly undying flames, they have indeed been able to create flames that don’t reduce or extinguish over time.

Whilst these irreducible, un-extinguishable flames at first seem as if they could be genuine Amaterasu, they always, at some point, reach a breaking point, the flames becoming unstable and losing their black color as they revert back to being normal flame once more.

Any damage dealing Katon ninjutsu can be modified into a Blaze ninjutsu, doing so increases the cha cost by 5 and gives the following effect:

Blaze:

This can be added onto any damage dealing Katon ninjutsu; It inflicts blaze equal to (the chakra cost of the jutsu used / 5)+1, not counting the increase to Blaze ninjutsu’s chakra cost from Blaze. Blaze functions identically to ignite, except that it does not reduce when it does damage, instead remaining for a duration of 20 IC. Repeated applications of Blaze stack with each other for severity, but not for duration. Ie, if a Blaze user inflicted a Blaze of 3 on someone for 20ic, then inflicted the same amount again. It does not become Blaze 6 for 25 more IC, but rather Blaze 6 for the same 20 IC as the first Blaze.

When the duration of Blaze finishes, add together all the damage the target took from ticks of the Blaze status effect, and compare that value vs their wounding thresholds. The target gains an energy wound of the highest severity that number meets. Roll 1d100 for location.

This does mean that if someone has both Blaze and Ignite on them, and the ignite is of higher severity, even if the Blaze is not doing any damage, you still need to track how much damage it would have done for the purpose of any Blaze wound inflicted.

It is perfectly possible for a jutsu to apply ignite, and Blaze, at the same time, but you still only apply the damage from whichever has a highest rank at any given time.

Blaze Ninjutsu costs 1 talent point and can only be taken if you have an affinity in Katon.

## **Abyss Release**

Long ago, a great and aging master of Suiton Ninjutsu dove deep into the ocean in search of a place to meditate on the deeper and more complex intricacies of his craft, hoping to discover insights to pass onto his sons and his son’s sons of the next generation.

He dove so deep that when he, days later, rose up from the depths he reported that the water he found below was different, it was heavier, more oppressive, and it sucked all light from the world around it.

The techniques he developed over the few remaining years of his life were inspired by those heavy, oppressive, and uncaring waters he found at the bottom of the ocean. Simply invoking one of his techniques could cause the sun to dim and candles to flicker out, and even the slightest contact with them would cause the oxygen to be drawn straight out of your blood through your skin. He called these techniques “Abyss”.

Effects:

Any damage dealing Suiton Ninjutsu can be converted into an Abyss technique by increasing its chakra cost by 5\. If you hit with an Abyss Ninjutsu and cause a wound, then the recipient is given a suffocation status, or has their existing suffocation status increased by 1 for each rank of the wound caused. Suffocation is added one after the other, not all at once. So if someone received a severe wound from an Abyss ninjutsu, they would gain suffocation 1, make the relevant stamina roll, gain suffocation 2, make another stamina roll, and then gain suffocation 3, for a third and final stamina roll. If an Abyss Ninjutsu hits someone, but they are not wounded, their stamina penalty increases by 1\.

Suffocation from Abyss Ninjutsu remains until you’ve rested, out of combat, for an hour, to give your blood cells a chance to recover from the invasive process of having the oxygen torn out of them.

The first time an Abyss jutsu is used in a battle, the weather conditions are changed to “Dusk/Dawn” if it had been “Daytime” before, or to “Daytime” if it had been “Glaring Sunlight” before.

Abyss Ninjutsu costs 1 talent point and can only be taken if you have an affinity in Suiton.

## **Plasma Release**

Long thought to be the result of a Kekkei Genkei originating in the hidden mist village, "Plasma Release" was later revealed to be a clan technique, the clan telling people it was a Kekkei Genkei in an attempt to prevent attempts to steal the technique from them. As they predicted, when the secret finally got out, it didn’t take too long before the clan technique was promptly stolen and the newly named "Plasma Ninjutsu" users could be found in all of the major hidden villages.

By using Raiton electricity to stimulate the atoms in the air, experienced Raiton using Nin have learned to create Plasma. It’s a soft, gooey substance that glows a pure white, with its edges looking a more purplish red. Every use of Plasma Ninjutsu leaves its effects on the battlefield, the air becoming more and more oxidized by each use of Plasma Ninjutsu. Eventually you can feel it around you, hair standing up on edge and the air taking on a crackling texture that claws at the tongue and throat as you breathe it in.

Before long, Plasma users are hurling terrifying beams of pure light and heat, battlefields turning into terrifying light shows of violence and destruction.

Effects:

You can change any damage dealing Raiton ninjutsu into a Plasma ninjutsu. When you first use a plasma ninjutsu in any battle you start tracking an “oxidized” value for the battlefield, the value going up by the chakra cost of each Plasma Ninjutsu you use. Plasma ninjutsu do “Oxidized” value/4% extra damage on all their attacks.

Plasma Ninjutsu have their chakra costs increased by 5, or by the current “Oxidized” value/20 (Rounded down), whichever is currently higher.

Plasma Ninjutsu costs 1 talent point and can only be taken if you have an affinity in Raiton.

## **Crystal Release**

Crystal Ninjutsu is separate from most ninjutsu techniques in that it was not actually developed by a ninja. Crystal Ninjutsu was the result of an aspiring entrepreneur not affiliated with any of the major villages experimenting with the effects of chakra on certain types of compounds in an attempt to turn lead to gold, or otherwise mundane objects into valuable ones.

Crystal Ninjutsu is the result of his experimentation, at first glance it seems as if earth that’s been transformed to crystal through this technique would be incredibly valuable, but the crystals formed by this technique are incredibly unstable, having a bad habit of shattering minutes after being created at best, and mere moments at worst.

This didn’t prevent the entrepreneur from running a notorious sequence of famous and incredibly profitable scams, using his newly developed technique, the spree lasting for a whole ten years until the Ninja Villages stepped in to hunt him down. Seeing the use of Crystal Ninjutsu on the battlefield, the man was eventually let go in exchange for teaching the ninja that caught him how to use his techniques.

Effects:

Any Doton Ninjutsu can be changed to a Crystal Ninjutsu by adding \+5 to its chakra cost, and has the following effects:

* If the Jutsu has a number of uses and/or degrades over time, these uses/time degradation are doubled.  
* If a Jutsu has an upkeep, its effects last for 20 IC after dropping it.  
* If a Jutsu crafts a construct with some HP value, this value is increased by 50%.  
* Crystal Ninjutsu inflict slashing wounds, unless the specific jutsu specifies otherwise.  
* Anyone hit by a Crystal Ninjutsu of any type gets a status of “Crystals” equal to the CHA cost of the jutsu/5. “Crystals” fully stacks with itself.

Crystals:

When somebody is hit by Crystal Ninjutsu, crystals start growing on them as well as everything around them. Track when you first take any ranks of Crystal, 30 IC from the IC you take your first rank of Crystal on, a shatter occurs.

Shatter:

When a Crystal Ninjutsu reaches the end of its duration, uses all of its limited uses, or is destroyed, a “Shatter” occurs. When a “Shatter” occurs, it causes a chain reaction, shattering all Crystal Ninjutsu on the battlefield. All Crystal Ninjutsu and all ranks of “Crystals” are removed from anyone who has them. For every person who had any ranks of “Crystals” on them, everyone within (Your NDB) range of that person (Including that person) is targeted by an attack using your Ninjutsu Accuracy. For the Target that actually had the Crystal Status Effect on them that Shattered, they 

The attack has an area of (NDB \* 1.5), and it does (Ranks of Crystal)d10, and counts as (Ranks of Crystal \* 2\) speed for Damage and Interrupt purposes. The Damage Type is Slashing.

Structures and other Crystal Ninjutsu creations created by Crystal Ninjutsu but don't actually hit anyone explode as if they had Crystal ranks equal to 1+CHA cost/4

Crystal Ninjutsu costs 1 talent point and can only be taken if you have an affinity in Doton.

## **Tempest Release**

Long before an infamous leaf shinobi thought up the existence of the village hidden in the sound, a group of clandestine Shinobi practiced the skill of Jutsu using it.

It is said that Tempest is, in fact, one of the oldest hyper elements developed as it is a more critical part of natural world than any of the others, and thus discovered long ago within the land of wind.

Unfortunately, the earlier years of Shinobi were filled with violence and much knowledge was lost from that Era-refugees containing only scraps of their original knowledge settled in the area that would one day become the Hidden Sand.

Today, Tempest Release is now widespread once more, the secrets shared or rediscovered all over again all over the world, but none can yet match the glory of the old ways just yet

Tempest Release

Any Fuuton Ninjutsu can be changed to a Tempest Ninjutsu by adding \+5 to its chakra cost, and has the following effects:

* Choose whether the Jutsu's Tempest spins Clockwise or Counterclockwise.  
* The Jutsu gains both a Line Area and a Circle Area if it didn't have one before and the appropriate Tags. The Line Area has a Width of (Chakra Cost/5)  and a Length equal to the distance between the user and the Target's square, to a max of the Jutsu's normal Range. Whilst the Circle Area has a Radius of (Chakra Cost/2) and is centered on the Target's square.  
* The Circle Area of the Jutsu remains even after the Jutsu resolves, remaining for 10 ICs in the shape of a Tempest on the battlefield that will either Push people away from the center of the Tempest if it's Clockwise, and Pull them into the center if its Counterclockwise. This applies a continuous Knockback Effect of 0.5+(Chakra Control/10) per IC to everybody within its Area towards the appropriate direction.  
* Anybody within the Tempest takes 10% of the original Jutsu's Damage every IC they spend in the Tempest.  
* If a Jutsu had either a Line Area or a Circle Area, then it has its Area increased by (Chakra Cost/5).

Tempest Ninjutsu costs 1 talent point and can only be taken if you have an affinity in Fuuton.
