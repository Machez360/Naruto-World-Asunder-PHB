# **Abilities**

## **What Abilities Are**

Abilities represent the fruits of your character's training, and the ways in which they've developed as a shinobi. What abilities you take will play a large role in shaping how you perform in combat and other situations.  
Abilities are more specific than skills; they differ from jutsu in that while a jutsu is a specific technique, any ability is a way of doing something or a permanent increase in your capabilities.

Most abilities are passive improvements, giving you new capabilities or making you able to do a certain thing better.  
You may choose to 'not use' a given ability at any time, essentially a form of holding back.

## **Purchasing Abilities**

Abilities are acquired by spending XP. Some abilities will list only a "Cost"; for those abilities, you spend that much XP and acquire the ability, and that is it.  
Others will list both a "Base Cost" and a "Scale." These abilities can be purchased more than once. The first time, you pay the Base Cost in XP; each future purchase has its cost increased by the Scale.  
For example, the Enhanced Hearing ability has Base Cost 4, Scale 3\. One rank of Enhanced Hearing would cost 4 XP.  
The second would cost (4+3) 7 XP, and the third would cost (4+3+3) 10 XP. So, the total XP spent to get all three ranks would be (4 \+ 7 \+ 10\) 21 XP.

Abilities with more than one rank will also include a Limit entry. This is what controls how many ranks of the ability you can have. So, if an ability (such as Attentive) said "Research /5" and you had 12 ranks of Research, you could buy that ability twice.  
Many abilities will include in their limit line a maximum, such as "Limit: CHA /10, max 4". This means that you may take that ability up to that many times (so in that example, 4).  
Certain abilities will also say "Requires: (something)". You cannot take any ranks in that ability unless you meet the requirement.

# **Chakra Abilities**

## **Nature Control**

### **Elemental Affinity**

Every ninja has a natural affinity for one of the five primary elements, though some may not discover it until later. This ability can be taken for any one of the five elements, even one your character cannot use.

For each rank, you get a \+1 bonus to Chakra Exhaustion and Chakra Control rolls involving your favored element. The Chakra Control skill requirements to learn jutsu of your chosen element are considered 1 point lower, per rank.  
Base Cost: 0  
Scale: \+1  
Limit: CHA /20, max 5  
Special: You may only take this ability for a single element, ever.

Some clans start with a specific Elemental Affinity, giving them one rank in this ability. This does not (necessarily) provide them with the matching Elemental Aptitude, though it does mean they cannot change their affinity.

### **Elemental Aptitude**

The shinobi of the world recognize five primary elements of chakra: fire, water, wind, earth, and lightning. These elements and their properties form the basis of most modern ninjutsu techniques.  
However, actually using elemental chakra requires the ability to convert one's own chakra to the appropriate element, which is what this ability provides.  
In simpler terms, when you take Elemental Aptitude, select one of the five elements; you may use elemental ninjutsu of that element.

Each additional rank of this ability allows you to use another element.  
Base Cost: 5  
Scale: \+25  
Limit: 3

Certain clans begin with one or more ranks in this ability. In these cases, they have the first one or two ranks in this ability for free, but must pay the scaled cost when buying the next one. For example, a Touu begins with elemental aptitude for Water and Wind. Normally, this would cost (5 \+ (5+25)) 35 XP; instead, it costs 0\. However, when they buy access to their third element, doing so costs 55 XP instead of (55 \+ 35\) 90 XP.

## **Shape Control**

### **Improved Area**

This supplements your Ninjutsu and Genjutsu Techniques, increasing their Area (So long as they have the appropriate tag) by up to your Ninjutsu Damage Bonus; to a max increase of half of the original Area.  
Purchasing the second Rank of this Ability changes it to NDB\*1.5 to a max of double of the original Area. you can use some, all, or none of this effect on a given technique, as you please.  
Base Cost: 15  
Scale: \+15  
Limit: CHA/50, Max 2\.

### **Improved Range**

You're able to keep your chakra coherent for longer; the further it can travel before dissipating (or the faster you can propel it, or whatever)... well, the advantages should be obvious. This increases the range of any ninjutsu techniques you use by up to double your ninjutsu damage bonus in yards. This bonus cannot exceed the technique's base range.  
Cost: 20

### **Potent Chakra**

You're able to increase your chakra's density, and in turn preserve some of the energy that would dissipate into the atmosphere around you in whatever sort of attack you're using.  
But all you really care about is that it makes your ninjutsu hurt more\!

Each rank increases your ninjutsu damage bonus by 0.2.  
Base Cost: 5
Scale: 0
Limit: CHA /10  
Requires: 80 CHA

## **Chakra Control**

### **Refined Chakra Control**

Your precise control of chakra allows you to spend it more efficiently, wasting less and getting more out of what you do spend.

Each rank of this ability gives you a \+1 bonus on your Chakra Exhaustion rolls.  
Base Cost: 6  
Scale: 2  
Limit: Chakra Control /5, max 5

### **Wall Walking**

Every village teaches this, usually to their genin, as a form of training to hone their chakra control skills. Training involves focusing a fixed amount of chakra at the bottom of one's feet and using that to adhere to a wall, tree, or other vertical surface.  
With this ability you can scale vertical surfaces, stand on ceilings, and so forth, at your normal movement speed.  
Cost: 10  
Requires: 8 Chakra Control

### **Water Walking**

You can stand on water\! Ninja do this in the same way they'd adhere to a vertical surface, though actually pulling it off is much harder because the water is constantly moving underneath them, meaning the strength and distribution of chakra has to be constantly changed. Once a shinobi is skilled enough, though, this becomes second nature, just like keeping one's balance on an unsteady surface.  
Cost: 15  
Requires: 15 Chakra Control, Wall Walking

## **Advanced Training**

### **Genjutsu Training**

You've mastered the art of... yeah, okay, no. You are able to use entry-level Genjutsu techniques. It's not much, but it's a start.

Cost: 25  
Requires: Medical Training talent, Skill Focus: Medicine 5

### **Advanced Seal Training**

As in sealing techniques, not handseals\! This allows you to learn the most advanced fuuinjutsu. These are often extremely complicated, and even slight mistakes result in them being useless. Through unrelenting practice and hours of study, you've gained a sufficient understanding of how and why seals work to be able to handle the most advanced techniques.  
This ability allows you to learn A-rank Sealing Ninjutsu.  
Cost: 25  
Requires: Seal Training talent, Skill Focus: Research 5

## **Genjutsu**

### **Attentive**

You pay lots of attention to details\! Beyond that, you're keen to pick up on things that other people wouldn't. Maybe that species of deer isn't native to this area, or the wood of an illusory wall is a type that isn't found in this part of the world.  
On the other hand, the more you know about these kinds of things, the more likely you are to get them right.

Each rank gives a \+1 bonus to your genjutsu rolls.  
Base Cost: 86 
Scale: 1
Limit: Research /5

### **Genjutsu Awareness**

You're good at picking up little details in your environment that aren't quite what they should be. Maybe it's that the ringing noise in your head isn't reverberating right, maybe it's that whoever constructed an illusion around you forgot to put door handles on all the doors.

Whatever it is, it gives you a \+1 bonus to defensive Genjutsu rolls per rank.  
Base Cost: 18
Scale: 2
Limit: Lower of your Enhanced Hearing or Enhanced Sight ranks

### **Genjutsu Competence**

Genjutsu is notoriously difficult; very few ninja are able to just 'pick it up' without difficulty. Even being mediocre with genjutsu requires a significant amount of training and practice--which this ability represents.

Each rank gives you a \+1 bonus to your offensive Genjutsu rolls.  
Base Cost: 3
Scale: 0  
Limit: (Diplomacy/2) \- 2

### **Genjutsu Mastery**

Each rank gives you a \+1 bonus to genjutsu rolls.  
Base Cost: 6  
Scale: 4

### **Illusion Multi-Targeting**

This allows you to apply a genjutsu which normally must target a single person at once to any number of people. Every 1 point of Willpower spent allows your genjutsu to target two more people, at no additional cost and using your same genjutsu roll.  
Cost: 25  
Requires: Know at least one C-rank Genjutsu.

# **Physical**

## **Vigor**

### **Brute Force**

You're good at... well, exactly what it sounds like: applying a lot of force all at once. It might be sheer physical strength, or you could just know how to strike properly.

Each rank increases your physical damage bonus by 0.2.  
Base Cost: 5 
Scale: 0
Limit: STR /10  
Requires: 80 STR

### **Endurance**

Base Cost: 15
Scale: 10
Limit: RES/40

### **Fortitude**

Every rank of this ability gives you a \+2 bonus to Resistance rolls when you block an attack (even if you are doing so reflexively); if you've declared that you're blocking, this also applies to any effects requiring a Resistance roll which you wouldn't normally get to defend against (such as the B-rank Poison Mist).

If you've declared you're blocking and take another defense half of this abilities bonus will still apply to your rolls.  
Base Cost: 2  
Scale: 2  
Limit: STR /20, max 5

### **Good Lungs**

All this ninja work has left you well beyond what peak physical condition would be for an ordinary person. In addition to being able to fight and exert yourself for abnormally long times, you recover from such exertion almost supernaturally fast.

When you use the Rest action to lower your Stamina penalty, it's reduced by 1 more per rank (so at two ranks, a Speed 5 Rest action would decrease your Stamina penalty by 3).  
Base Cost: 10  
Scale: 5  
Limit: RES /80

### **Hard to Kill**

You prove distressingly difficult to make dead.

Your max Vitality and HP are increased by 10% per rank. However, Wounds are calculated off your unmodified ("true") maximums.  
For example, if you had 1000 Vitality and 3 ranks of Hard to Kill, you'd have 1300 Vitality. However, your "true" maximum would still be 1000, and wounds would be determined based off what percent of 1000 Vitality their damage was.  
Base Cost: 6  
Scale: 1  
Limit: RES /20  
Requires: 80 RES

### **Healthy**

You get plenty of exercise, and probably eat healthily. When your job places serious physical demands upon you (such as leaping across chasms and running over rooftops), this can be useful.

Scale: 2  
Limit: Athletics /5

You put extra force behind your unarmed strikes, turning your feeble punches into fearsome punches\! Or... something like that.

Base Cost: 6

### **Unarmed Focus**

You've trained to improve your sheer physical prowess; even when resorting to simple, non-jutsu attacks, you hit hard. May or may not be the result of deciding to train by punching trees until your knuckles bleed.

Base Cost: 3  
Scale: 0  
Limit: (STR \- 20\) /10

### **Runner**

You're both a distance runner and sprinter\! Pretty awesome, huh?

Scale: 2  
Limit: (AGI \- 50\) /10, max 5

## **Combo**

### **Cadence**

Base Cost: 30  
Limit: RES/60, max 1\.

### **Momentum Sprinter**

You have trained to keep your eyes on the ball, even if you need to chase it all around the field you never lose momentum.

You may take the Move Action without breaking your current Combo. At the second rank you can also use Shunshin no Jutsu without breaking your current Combo.

Cost: 10  
Scale: 15  
Limit: 2

### **Shadowboxer**

Even when people hide from you, you manage to look for them without losing steam for a while.

By reducing your Combo Counter by 1 point, you can perform a single Search action without breaking your Combo. This cannot be done if lowering your Combo Counter would bring it to 0\.			

Cost: 15  
Scale: 0  
Limit: 1

### **Somatic Caster**

Sometimes you need to kick it up a notch in the middle of a sequence, perhaps your attacks are not strong enough or there’s a particular defense you can’t get around. Luckily Ninjutsu is there to solve your problems.

You can use one non-interrupt Ninjutsu technique at any point during your current Combo without breaking it.

Cost: 15  
Scale: 0  
Limit: 1  
Requires: Chakra Control 15

Cost: 10  
Scale: 0  
Limit: 5

### **Signature Move**

You've trained yourself to be deadly efficient with one specific finisher.

“I had to give him the three piece … with the soda” \- Old Ninja proverb.

 

Choose one unarmed finisher taijutsu you know. When you use “Sudden Attack” alongside that finisher, instead of reducing your damage by 10% per rank of sudden attack used, it reduces your damage by 10-(Combo Counter)% per rank of sudden attack used.

 

Cost: 20  
Scale: 0  
Limit: 1  
Requires: STR 60

# **Sensory**

## **Enhanced Senses**

### **Enhanced Hearing**

Your hearing isn't actually (much) better than a normal person's, but you've learned how to not do what everyone normally does: tune out quiet, 'insignificant' background noises. You still can if you need to, but you can also avoid doing that, when you need to, say, listen for a skulking opponent.

This gives you a \+1 bonus to Awareness rolls per rank.  
Base Cost: 4  
Scale: 3  
Limit: CHA /10, max 4  
Special: The two "Enhanced (Sense)" abilities share a Scale.  
That is, if you already had four ranks of Enhanced Sight, the first rank of Enhanced Hearing would cost (4+(3\*4) \= ) 16 XP.

### **Enhanced Sight**

You're very good with attention to detail. You notice things that other people overlook, and as it turns you, that's a pretty useful job-related talent for a ninja.

You get \+1 Awareness per rank.  
Base Cost: 4  
Scale: 3  
Limit: CHA /10, max 4  
Special: The two "Enhanced (Sense)" abilities share a Scale.  
That is, if you already had four ranks of Enhanced Sight, the first rank of Enhanced Hearing would cost (4+(3\*4) \= ) 16 XP.

### **Blind Fighting**

Between smoke bombs, stealth missions at night, and hostile ninjutsu, shinobi often find themselves operating with their vision impaired. This ability represents training to fight while relying on your other senses.

Each rank of Blind Fighting reduces the maximum visibility penalty you can suffer from by 1\.  
Base Cost: 7  
Scale: 2  
Limit: Enhanced Hearing ranks, max 4

### **Keen Senses**

You're very good at picking up on tiny things that are just everso-slightly out of place\!

Normally, you get a cumulative \+2 bonus every time you attempt to find someone using a Search action in combat. This raises that to \+3 at the first rank, and \+4 at the second.  
Base Cost: 8  
Scale: 4  
Limit: (Enhanced Sight ranks) /2

## **Perception**

### **Accurate**

You've got good hand-eye coordination, which lends itself towards hitting with your attacks. You have a \+1 bonus per rank to your Accuracy.   
Base Cost: 4   
Scale: 2   
Limit: DEX /20, max 10

### **Instinct**

You've learned to rely on your instincts to guide you in battle, helping to improve your reaction time. Not by much--but enough to matter.

Each rank gives a \+1 bonus to dodge.  
Base Cost: 8  
Scale: 2  
Limit: Survival /5

### **Sixth Sense**

Ninja really do seem to have one, and no experienced shinobi will deny it, not once they've faced down an opponent and actually, physically felt the killing intent radiating from them, or experienced a half-second of dread in the instant before an ambush was sprung. Nobody can quantify it, or say for sure what causes it, but ninja who don't want to die do well to listen to it.

You have a \+1 bonus to Awareness and dodge rolls per rank. Whenever you would be sneak attacked this can, optionally, activate, removing any Stalker ACC bonuses from the sneak attack and giving you a free speed 0 search action before the attack takes place. You can also activate Sixth Sense on your opponent's IC, before they declare or resolve their action, in order to take a Search action as a Speed 0 Interrupt. Each time this activates, the Awareness and defensive bonuses are reduced by 1 each; once they reach 0, your Sixth Sense stops functioning. This refreshes at the beginning of each day.

You can always spend up to your current Sixth Sense ranks in AP on defenses made vs surprise or sneak attacks, regardless of whether you’ve chosen to activate your sixth sense or not.

Base Cost: 10

Scale: 4

Limit: CHA /40

 

# **Subtlety**

## **Deception**

### **Cunning**

You're an expert at misdirection; you know the signs people look for and pick up on in battle, and you know how to either give the wrong ones, or none at all.

This gives you a \+1 bonus to Accuracy per rank.  
Base Cost: 8  
Scale: 2  
Limit: Espionage /5

### **Cunning Blow**

### **Stalker**

Somewhere along the way you picked up the unpleasant, but highly effective talent of being able to follow people for prolonged periods of time without being noticed.

Each rank gives you \+1 to your Stealth TN once you're already hidden. The odd ranks (1, 3, and 5\) each give \+1 to your Accuracy with Sneak Attacks made from stealth.  
Base Cost: 6  
Scale: 3  
Limit: DEX /20, max 5

### **Subterfuge**

You are all kinds of sneaky. You know how to lie and make it seem like you're telling the truth, or how to tell the truth while convincing anyone listening that it's a lie.

Every rank gives you \+1 to Espionage and Stealth rolls.  
Base Cost: 3  
Scale: 2  
Limit: Espionage /3, max 5

## **Ninja Tactics**

### **Basic Training**

Ninja with the ability to use chakra can get away with not solving every problem through the application of stealth and cunning, it's true. But, to be viewed as a proper ninja, they need to be keenly aware of their surroundings, masters of deception, and able to vanish like a shadow. In practice, genin find those things exceptionally boring, especially when they could be learning how to shoot fireballs instead.

Every rank gives you a \+1 bonus to Accuracy, defensive rolls, and skill checks. Defensive rolls which use accuracy only get \+1 per rank from Basic training, not \+2.  
Base Cost: 10  
Scale: 5  
Limit: Lower of Awareness /5, Espionage /5, or Stealth /5; max 5 ranks

### **Defensive Formation**

You take up a position protecting someone from harm. Very useful on escort missions when you have to keep some blubbering civilian safe\! 

This is a variable Speed Defensive Basic Action, you designate one or more (up to 1+XP/1000) targets within AGI/20 yards of you. If one of those people is attacked before you take a non-interrupt action, you may immediately attempt to Take The Hit as a Speed 0 Interrupt, with a \+10 bonus.

The designated targets must be within AGI/20 of you for this ability to take effect. They can move out and back in at will. Designating new targets requires another use of this Action.

Cost: 25

### **Guard**

You ready yourself for an impending attack. 

This is a variable Speed Defensive Basic Action. Until your next non-interrupt action, you have a \+5 bonus to accuracy when parrying enemy attacks (including with jutsu, such as Halting Blow and Crossroads of Heaven). Your Parry action itself becomes a Speed 0 Interrupt.

Cost: 20  
Requires: 45 DEX

### **Safety Dance**

This does not actually have anything to do with dancing. Indeed, if you are dancing, you probably won't be able to pull this off\! You stay on edge while recuperating mid-battle, never letting your guard down.

When you take a Rest action, you may increase its speed by one to be considered to be Blocking until your next nonInterrupt action.  
Cost: 60  
Requires: 60 STR

### **Survival Tactics, Basic**

You know how to fend for yourself, in the wilderness and on missions. It encompasses a lot of things, but one of the basics for a ninja is being able to not be discovered when their opponents; discretion is absolutely the better part of valor, after all.

Each rank gives a \+1 bonus to Stealth and Survival rolls.  
Base Cost: 6  
Scale: 2  
Limit: AGI /10, max 5  
Requires: Survival 5

### **Survival Tactics, Advanced**

Not getting caught by one's opponents is always preferable when outmatched, but sometimes that's not an option. You now know how to fend for yourself in combat, as well\! Each rank gives a \+1 bonus to dodge and Survival rolls.   
Base Cost: 8   
Scale: 1   
Limit: (DEX \- 50\) /10, max 5  
Requires: Basic Survival Tactics 5, Survival 20

### **Total Defense**

You abandon all forms of attack and focus on staying alive. 

This is a variable Speed Defensive Basic Action. Until your next non-interrupt action, your Dodge action becomes a Speed 0 Interrupt and has a \+3 bonus.

Cost: 20  
Requires: 45 AGI

 

# **Equipment**

## **Ninja Tools**

### **Bingo Book**

The bingo book is a pocket-sized book put out by each village, with information on missing nin and enemy ninja of note. This information includes their bounties, their reputation, and any abilities which the village may be willing to publicize. Having this ability means you keep an up-to-date copy of the bingo book; you can steal someone else's, but they generally get updated every few months.  
Cost: 5

### **Icha Icha Novels**

Icha Icha is a series of best-selling novels written by the legendary ninja sage Jiraiya. They are comedic (and adult) recounts of Jiraiya's experiences in love. The titles include Icha Icha Paradise, Icha Icha Violence, Icha Icha Tactics, and Icha Icha Utopia. They are intended only for audiences over 18 years of age, and managing to acquire and read them in secret is a challenge countless young ninja strive to overcome. Indeed, it's how many shinobi (though most kunoichi would never admit it) hone their abilities of stealth and deception. For every rank, you have read one of the Icha Icha novels.

Every novel you've read gives you a \+1 bonus to your Espionage rolls.  
Base Cost: 6  
Scale: 4  
Limit: 4

### **Aerosolized Poisons**

As popular as poisons are with (some) shinobi, they suffer from being relatively difficult to deliver effectively. While gaseous poisons are one of the most effective ways of accomplishing that, very few of the toxins suitable for use against shinobi can be deployed that way.  
Unless, of course, someone is willing to invest a great deal of time and resources into specially preparing those poisons, and learning enough about them to understand the dangers of those preparations. Like you\!  
This ability allows you to create a Poison Smoke Bomb from any Contact poison (as found in the Equipment chapter) and converts that poisons type to Inhalation.  
The total cost for the poison smoke bomb is doubled (for example, Water Hemlock Poison Smoke Bombs would be 1200 ryo each), and the Toxicology roll has a \-4 penalty.

Cost: 50  
Requires: 25 Toxicology

### **Tag Concealment**

Ninjas do love their explosions. However, they also like being sneaky and unseen; this combines the two\!  
When placing an exploding tag, you can hide it from the casual observer. This requires something for it to be hidden under (such as loose soil, or leaves; you cannot 'hide' them in plain sight in a featureless room). Hiding a tag is a Speed 10 action, and anyone watching you will realize what you're doing and where it is (meaning it cannot be accomplished outside of stealth in combat).  
When you hide the tag, make an Espionage roll. Anyone who enters the tag's range is allowed an Awareness roll against the result, without any bonuses they may have from the Enhanced Hearing ability. Success means they've spotted the tag.  
Once a tag has begun its countdown to detonation they start to sizzle and spark, alerting anyone to their presence and approximate direction (though not exact location), giving them a chance to escape before time runs out.

Cost: 10

## **Weapons, Melee**

### **Ambidextrous**

You've trained yourself to use your off-hand just as well as your dominant one, or you really are naturally ambidextrous.

Each rank reduces the Accuracy penalty for the Dual Wield Attack action (see below) and derivatives of it such as Centipede Strike by 1\.

Base Cost: 5  
Scale: 2  
Limit: DEX /20, max 5

### **En-Guard**

Heightening your reflexes with weaponry you’re now able to prepare your battle stance at a moment's notice.

After gaining this Ability, whenever you start or enter a Combat encounter, you may choose to start in either the Heaven, Earth, or Void Stances instead of the Neutral Stance.

Base Cost: 15  
Scale: 0  
Limit: Athletics 15

### **Dual Wielding**

You attack with a weapon in each hand\! Impractical, but awesome. As might be expected, this allows you to make a basic weapon attack with both weapons simultaneously.  
Halve the speed of both the weapons you're using (rounding up, as usual). Add those two numbers together to get the speed of your "Dual Wield Attack" action.  
You use the lower of the two weapons' Accuracy. This is defended against as a single attack, using its total Speed. The Stamina cost to Dual-Wield is the higher Stamina cost of the two weapons, plus one third of the lower Stamina cost.  
If you hit, you deal damage separately for both weapons, using the reduced Speed for each to determine their damage bonus. Weapons specifically marked as "Dual" calculate damage based on their natural Speed, rather than the halved value.  
Lowering the Speed of a Dual Wield Attack action lowers the effective Speeds (for determining damage) of both component attacks by the same amount.  
This can't be done with two-handed weapons.  
Unfortuantely, the Dual Wield Attack action (and derivatives of it such as Centipede Strike) carries with it a \-5 Accuracy penalty.

Cost: 25  
Requires: 40 DEX

### **Monkey Grip**

By using extreme strength, chakra-based powers, and a cheerful disregard for physics, you are able to use twohanded weapons in one hand\! Notably, this means they no longer benefit from their 50% increase in your damage bonus. Tho change from weilding a two handed weapon in two hands to one hand or back to two hands, you must take a speed 0 non-interrupt action to make the change in hand placement. In this case, if you chose to hold the two handed weapon in one hand, you could use an item with that one hand or do other actions that require one hand. This change is a non-interrupt action meaning if you are holding the weapon with both hands you would not be able to use an item or jutsu as part of a defense.  
At the second rank you can, if you have the Dual Wield ability, even dual wield two-handed weapons.  
Base Cost: 30  
Scale: \+10  
Limit: STR /50, max 2

### **Quick Draw**

The speed of your Draw Weapon is reduced by 1 per rank, to a minimum of 0\.  
Base Cost: 7  
Scale: 1  
Limit: DEX /30

### **Weapon Focus: (Weapon)**

You’ve trained yourself specifically with a single type of weapon. Choose one of the weapon shapes from the Equipment chapter (such as Sword, or Club). You have \+1 Accuracy and \+1 to your damage bonus when using that weapon to make an attack, per rank. Weapon focus cannot be applied to defensive rolls, nor to any other use that have no associated stamina cost. You may take this ability for different weapons, counting as a different ability (with a separate cost, number of ranks, etc.) each time. Any attack which benefits from your Weapon Focus has its Stamina cost increased by 3 per rank; you may choose to use less than your full ranks of Weapon Focus on a given attack if you wish.

Base Cost: 6  
Scale: 2  
Limit: (DEX \-30) /30, max 3

### **Blunt: Stun**

Your attacks stagger an opponent, club them upside the head, knock the wind out of them, or otherwise keeping them from recovering.

Your blunt weapon attacks gain Stun 1 per rank, or increase their existing Stun by 1 per rank.  
Base Cost: 5  
Scale: 2  
Limit: STR /20

### **Large/Extreme: Momentum**

You turn one of the greatest enemies of shinobi--physics--to your own ends.

Each rank gives a \-1 penalty to any enemy's attempts to parry your weapon.  
Base Cost: 4  
Scale: 2  
Limit: STR /20, max 5

### **Piercing: Penetrate**

Your piercing weapons gain 'Ignore Armor' which allow them to bypass any armor your opponent is wearing\!  
Cost: 20  
Requires: 35 STR

### **Polearm: Trip**

You sweep with the blunt end (or one of the blunt ends) of your weapon, knocking your opponent's feet out from beneath them. This allows you to use Trip (the E-rank Unarmed Taijutsu technique) as a Weapon Taijutsu, as long as you know it.  
Cost: 10

### **Slashing: Perfect Cut**

Normally, when partial defense applies you would deal 20% of your attack's damage per point you hit by. With this ability you do 25% per point you hit by, up to full damage if you hit by 4 points.  
Cost: 20  
Requires: 40 DEX

### **Small: Flurry**

Most of the small weapons rely on something other than overpowering force to deal their damage; accordingly, a dozen quick strikes is often preferable to six slow, powerful ones.  
Each time you make an attack with a Small weapon, the total Speed of your next attack with that weapon is reduced by 1\. This stacks for consecutive attacks; if you make three attacks with your weapon, without taking any non-Interrupt action inbetween, the next attack would have \-3 total Speed.  
As a reminder, total Speed cannot go below half of base Speed.

The maximum reduction is your number of ranks in this ability.  
Base Cost: 4  
Scale: 2  
Limit: DEX /20

### **Sword: Iaijutsu**

If you attack with a sword you have to draw (meaning it hasn't been used for parries or jutsu since it was sheathed or hasn't been used in combat yet) the attack's Speed is halved, though for the purpose of damage calculations it's treated as its regular speed. This may only be done once per battle, even if you have more than one sword.

Cost: 20  
Requires: 50 DEX, 40 AGI

## **Weapons, Ranged**

### **Assassin's Eye**

You've got a good eye for causing bodily harm to people from a distance. In any other job, this would just make you kind of scary. As a ninja, it looks good on your resume\!

Each rank of this ability reduces the penalty for called shots with ranged weapons by 1\.  
Base Cost: 6  
Scale: 4  
Limit: DEX /30, max 3  
Requires: Enhanced Sight 3

### **Combat Acupuncture**

You can throw senbon to target vital points on an opponent's body. Whenever making a called shot with senbon, if you deal damage you inflict a \-1 immobilization penalty on your foe.

Using this on somebody already suffering from it increases the Immobilization penalty by 1 each time. Its effects end entirely 20 IC after the last time you hit with a senbon called shot. The maximum penalty is your ranks in Combat Acupuncture.

Base Cost: 2  
Scale: 2  
Limit: DEX /10, Medicine/2, Max 10  
Requires: Doctor 1, Medical Training Talent

### **Explosive Tag Connection**

As a Speed 10 \+ 5 \* X action, you can attach X tags to a kunai's hilt or an arrow, and prime them. These can be attached pre-battle as a matter of convenience, but the action to prime them is still necessary. You can have up to (Chakra Control)/5 tags primed this way at once.  
Each item (kunai or arrow) may only have a single tag attached to it. You can trigger these tags as part of a multithrow, or do so later (such as by the Remote Detonation technique). When the kunai is thrown (or arrow shot) the tag(s) will detonate 15 IC after impact (with the target, or the ground at the target's feet on a miss).  
When used as a multi-throw, each tagged kunai counts as two weapons for the purpose of determining multi-throwing limit. You can include up to one tag per rank in this ability in a single throw.  
If a target is struck by the arrow or kunai, they're assumed to pull it out as a non-action and can try to escape the area.  
Justu including exploding tags that cause them to explode on contact supercede these rules.

Base Cost: 5  
Scale: 3  
Limit: Chakra Control / 5

### **Improved Range**

You can throw weapons farther than other people\! It's useful, honest\!... Kind of. Sometimes.  
Your max range with thrown weapons is increased by your physical damage bonus.  
Cost: 15

### **Marksman**

You've got uncannily good aim at a distance. You may give your ranged weapon attacks a bonus of up to \+1 Accuracy per rank. However, each \+1 received this way increases the Stamina cost of the action by 2\.  
In the case of ninjutsu which behave as ranged weapon attacks, increase whichever cost(s) the technique has (such as the Chakra cost on the D-rank Attached Meteor technique).

Base Cost: 8  
Scale: 4  
Limit: DEX /30

### **Quick Hands**

You're very good at throwing lots of small objects very quickly\!  
This allows you to throw an extra 1 die of weapons when multi-throwing, without increasing the action's Speed; the Stamina cost is still increased normally (+1 for every 2 weapons total, adding together ones added normally and ones added by Quick Hands).

Base Cost: 5  
Scale: 1  
Limiting Attribute: DEX /20

### **Senbon Multi-Throw**

You can multi-throw needles, just like you can normally multi throw shuriken and kunai.

Cost: 15  
Requires: 30 DEX, Athletics 5

### **Senbon User**

You're a person who uses senbon in combat. This is rare, but not unheard of; it takes a lot of effort to get results out of them, but a weapon that allows the degree of precision they do can certainly be rewarding.

This ability removes their inherent \-2 Accuracy penalty, and allows you to use your DEX, rather than STR, to determine your damage bonus with senbon. Finally, damage dealt by senbon is tripled for the purposes of calculating wounds.

Cost: 15  
Requires: 25 DEX, Medicine 5

### **Surgical Precision**

When you wound an enemy with a senbon attack, you have a 10% chance per rank for the wound to be upgraded to the next-highest rank. If you don't wound them, this is replaced by a 10% chance per rank to cause a minor wound, so long as your attack did any damage. Every rank of this ability also raises the attack's Stamina cost by 1; you can choose whether or not to use it, and to what extent, when you attack.

If used on a multi-throwing attack with senbon, this is applied before the one-rank reduction in wound severity (from being a multi-throw).

Cost: 2  
Scale: 2  
Limit: DEX/10, Medicine /2, max 10  
Requires: Doctor 2, Medical Training Talent

# **Other**

## **Willpower**

### **Desperation**

Being faced with truly dire straits brings out remarkable characteristics: in animals, in civilians, and in shinobi. Thankfully, you're one of those\!  
You can activate this ability when defending against an attack by spending a point of Willpower. Your Interrupt only needs to be double or less the Speed of the attack you're defending against, rather than half or less. This effect persists for the duration of 10 ICs; if you're being attacked four times in that duration , then all four defenses would receive this benefit.

Cost: 40  
Requires: 5 Willpower

### **Determination**

Your force of will is as powerful an advantage in combat as your strength of body.

Each rank of this ability increases your Willpower by 1\.  
Base Cost: 25
Limit: XP /1000

### **Focus**

Being left reeling and disoriented is an all-too-common experience for shinobi. Sometimes it's the result of genjutsu, other times it's a lucky blow to the solar plexus (or... lower).  
You're able to bring yourself back to the presence, by sheer mental fortitude, though doing so is bound to wear you out faster in the long run. By spending 1 Willpower, you end any Stuns you're suffering from and become immune to any other instances of that status effect until the end of the current Initiative Count.

Cost: 40  
Requires: 4 Willpower

### **Guts**

You refuse to go down in battle. So long as you're physically able to breathe, you will not stop fighting when your values are on the line. This can get downright frightening to behold, depending upon the circumstances.  
Whenever you would be reduced to 0 HP or lower, roll a TN 25 Stamina check. If you succeed, you are left with 1 HP, and cannot have your HP reduced until the end of that initiative count. If you fail, in addition to your Fatigue progressing you take the damage you normally would have from the attack. Damage negated through this ability still wounds you normally.

Cost: 50  
Requires: 3 Willpower

### **Limit Break**

Through sheer determination you force yourself to perform above your own capabilities. Once per day, per rank, you may reroll any roll, or replace an Accuracy number with a d20 roll that adds your normal Accuracy rating as a bonus (not including the base 10 Accuracy).  If this is a d20 roll and the result is below 11, add 10 to the die roll.

Using Limit Break causes you to immediately proceed to the next Fatigue category.

This ability can be used after you've determined whether your roll or attack would've succeeded normally.

Base Cost: 20  
Scale: 5  
Limit: Willpower /2

## **Initiative**

### **Defensive Reflexes**

You're always ready to protect yourself, even when caught off guard. You may declare use of this ability when rolling your initiative for combat. You are considered to be blocking at the start of battle, but take a \-4 penalty on your initiative roll.

This penalty is reduced by 1 for each rank beyond the first.  
Base Cost: 10  
Scale: \-2  
Limiting Attribute: RES/20, max 3

### **Reflexes**

You have excellent twitch reflexes. Mostly, this comes in handy for a ninja; you respond to danger before even fully determining what that danger is. This can be kind of awkward off-duty, when you respond to somebody trying to startle you by punching them in the gut and then flipping them over your shoulder, but that's what they get for trying to startle a ninja anyway.

Each rank gives you \+1 Initiative and each even rank gives a \+1 Athletics bonus.  
Base Cost: 5  
Scale: 1  
Limiting Attribute: AGI /10, Max 20

### **Rush**

You don't waste time doing things like getting warmed up and taking stock of the battlefield, instead opting to rush right into battle and make things up as you go along\!

You start battle with (AGI)\*(number of ranks in this ability)/20 AP.  
Base Cost: 4  
Scale: 2  
Limiting Attribute: AGI /20, max 5

### **Preparation**

You may, as part of your Initiative roll, activate one or more techniques with Upkeeps that affect only yourself. You must pay their Chakra or Stamina costs normally.  
The total of the (Speed \+ modified Seal Speed) of all the techniques you use cannot exceed whatever you rolled for your initiative.

Cost: 40  
Requires: 60 DEX

## **Action Points**

### **Active**

You get a lot done in combat. Whether it's quickly assessing the battlefield, exploiting an opening, or having that extra bit of adrenaline, you're already doing what needs to be done.

Every rank in this ability increases the AP you naturally gain each 20 IC by 1\. Thus, if you had 3 ranks of Active, you'd get (5 \+ 3\) 8 AP every time the IC reached a multiple of 20\.  
Base Cost: 2  
Scale: 1  
Limit: AGI /20

### **Principle of Motion**

You're able to act blindingly fast, beyond what all reason suggests should be possible. You may at any time cause your next action to come 1 IC earlier for every 2 AP you spend.  
For example, say it's initiative count 200, and you just took a speed 12 action. Your action ends that IC, moving the battle onto IC 201; normally your next action would occur on IC (200+12) \= 212\. By spending 22 AP, you could act on (IC 212 \- 11\) 201, in other words, immediately.  
This only allows your next action to come sooner; it does not let you finish an ongoing action sooner. As such, Principle of Motion can't be used to make you finish Handseals early, or while you are in the process of using any action with a Delay.  
Similarly, you can not use Principle of Motion to reverse time. You may use Principle of Motion only to bring your next action to what the current initiative count is. This means that if you take an action on IC 16, once it is resolved IC 17 begins--and that is the earliest you could activate Principle of Motion, meaning you would be unable to act twice on the same initiative count.  
After using Principle of Motion, you may not use it again until 10 IC have passed. You may not use Principle of Motion while stunned.

Cost: 60  
Requires: 100 DEX, 100 AGI

### **Surge**

You can spend AP to improve an attack's accuracy, or a defensive action's roll. This costs 8 AP per \+1 Accuracy, and 5 AP per \+1 to a defensive roll. Either way, Surge may give a maximum of a \+5 bonus, and is declared when the roll (or attack) is made.

Cost: 40  
Requires: 80 AGI

## **Skill**

### **Anatomical Knowledge**

Your knowledge of the human body develops sinister undertones. You can't learn how to treat life-threatening injuries without picking up more than a little bit of knowledge of how to cause life-threatening injuries.

Each rank causes your taijutsu attacks (including those with ranged weapons, just as a reminder) to calculate wounds as if their damage was 5% higher.  
Base Cost: 6  
Scale: 2  
Limit: Medicine /5

### **Doctor**

Aside from the basics of health and biology, and how to stabilize a dying comrade on the field, you've learned how to provide longer-term care for your allies.

At the first rank of this ability, you are able to provide 'medical attention' to people (as per the Recovery node in the combat chapter). Doing so requires you to have access to one First Aid kit per person you treat this way.

At the second rank, you may do this even without a First Aid kit. Finally, at the third rank, the recovery times for all people you are treating are halved, even beyond the normal reductions for receiving medical attention--you're just that good.

You can treat a number of people at once equal to (Medicine Rank/10) Per Downtime Action spent this way. This is long-term treatment, so you can still take breaks, sleep, and so forth, as long as you are devoting most of your downtime to helping them heal.

Base Cost: 10  
Scale: 5  
Limit: (Medicine \- 5\) /5, Max 3

### **General Knowledge**

You know a little bit about everything, and a lot about a few things. Unfortunately, most of a ninja's abilities depend upon talent rather than knowledge. For those that don't, you've got an extra edge\!

You have \+1 per rank to Medicine, Survival, and Toxicology rolls.  
Base Cost: 5  
Scale: 2  
Limit: Research /5

### **Skill Focus: (Skill)**

This ability allows you to focus on a single skill at the expense of your overall performance. Most of the skills a ninja develops are picked up as a course of their regular training and experience. Skill focus represents taking extra time to focus on a specific talent, to the expense of all others.

Each rank of Skill Focus increases your rank in the chosen skill by 1\. This is an actual increase in rank, for all purposes, not a "bonus". This ignores and does not count against the normal limit on skill ranks. You may take Skill Focus for multiple skills, each time treating it as a different ability with a separate cost scale.

Base Cost: 2 Skill Points  
Scale: \+1 Skill Point every odd-numbered rank  
(Ranks 1 and 2 cost 2 SP; ranks 3 and 4 cost 3 SP; and so forth).

### **Specialization**

You practice extensively with a chosen skill, so that even while you may still make mistakes, you don't make catastrophic ones; even at your worst, you're not terrible. Any time you roll below an 8 on a roll with that skill, your d20 roll is instead considered to be an 8\.  
You may take this ability multiple times.

Each time you take it, it applies to a different skill.  
Base Cost: 10  
Scale: 0  
Requires: At least 5 ranks in each skill it's applied to.

## **Development**

### **Progression**

Ordinarily, when raising your attributes, the amount you've raised one by must be within 3 points of the amount the nexthighest has been raised by, and so forth (the 'rule of 3').  
Every rank in this ability loosens that restriction by one.  
Thus, instead of having spent XP to raise three stats by \+3, \+6, and \+9, you could have a progression of \+4, \+8, and \+12.

Base Cost: 10  
Scale: 0  
Limit: XP/750
