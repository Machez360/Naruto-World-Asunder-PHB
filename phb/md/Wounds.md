# **Wounds**

## **Explanation**

Shinobi can, and frequently do, endure beatings that would leave ordinary people as lifeless, mangled pulps--something about the increased flow of chakra and physical conditioning giving them unnatural durability.

Enough of a beating, over a long enough period of time, will still bring a ninja down, but little things like getting knocked off a roof or stabbed with a knife are not nearly so fatal as they'd be for normal people.

Even so, some blows are too much to just shrug off. These are called wounds, injuries that have some lasting effect on your ability to fight.

## **Wound Categories**

Wounds are divided into four categories, based on their severity: Minor, Major, Severe, and Critical.

Simply put, you acquire wounds by taking too much damage at once. When a single source of damage deals more than a certain percent of your maximum Vitality at once, you suffer a wound of the corresponding severity.

*Minor: 10%*  
*Major: 25%*  
*Severe: 50%*  
*Critical: 75%*

Damage dealt to your HP wounds you based on your maximum HP, as should make sense\! However, the percentages are higher, to offset HP being much lower than Vitality

*Minor: 25%*  
*Major: 50%*  
*Severe: 75%*

For the sake of demonstration, we'll say that you have 600 Vitality, and 200 HP. An attack hits you for 100 damage. If you take this damage to your vitality (16%), you suffer one Minor wound. If you take it to your HP (50%), you'd instead suffer a Major wound.

On the other hand, if you had 60 Vitality remaining when that same attack hit, you'd lose 60 Vitality (10%) and 40 HP (25%), resulting in two Minor wounds.

## **Damage Types**

After determining the severity of a wound, the next (fairly simple\!) step is determining what type of wound it is. Being cut by a sword and being hit by a magical ninja fireball, even if they do the same amount of damage, have significantly different effects on the human body.

For the most part this is self-explanatory, with only four damage types recognized: Blunt, Slashing, Piercing, and Energy.

Unarmed attacks are always blunt damage, nice and simple.

Weapons have their damage type, or types, listed in their descriptions. If a weapon can do multiple types of damage, the attacker declares which type of wound they'll be inflicting after the severity is confirmed, but before the location is determined. Some weapon jutsu require a weapon of a specific damage type to be used; in this case, damage from that jutsu is considered to be of that type.

Ninjutsu are simpler than weapons\! Katon and Raiton jutsu inflict energy damage. Doton and Suiton inflict blunt damage. Fuuton inflicts slashing damage. An exception\! Some jutsu augment a weapon strike, or actually create a weapon. In these cases, use the damage type of that weapon, not the element it was made from.

## **Location**

After determining severity and damage type, you roll to determine location--where you hit, and what you injured. It's all well and good to say you threw a punch at their face, but this is a battle with ninjas\! Things rarely go as planned.

You roll a percentile die (1d100) for location, and check the relevant damage type's wound list, under the appropriate severity, to determine the effect. If it's an arm or leg that's been wounded, odds on the 1d100 are the right arm, and evens the left.

This all gets simpler if the defender is blocking; in that case, they choose the location. Even if you used a Called Shot.

Multiple wounds, even multiples of the same effect, stack. Two broken left arms means that your arm is broken twice, with double the normal penalties.

One exception. If you suffer a critical wound, it overrides all lesser wounds on that location--having an arm reduced to useless deadweight makes the fact that it's broken in six places kind of, well, irrelevant. Two criticals in the same place, however, is oh so very possible.

An important note to keep in mind, if two or more Wounds are applied at the same time (In a single Attack or Effect, for example), they are considered to be applied one after the other. With the higher Severity being applied first, then the lesser Severity. If they were both of the same Severity and Location, then the person who applied them gets to choose which is considered to be applied first.

## **Called Shots**

A called shot is an attack specifically targeting a certain location. After checking your attack's damage type, choose any of the locations which can be Wounded by damage of that type. You declare that when you make your attack, for example, "Hinotama, Called Shot: Arm".

The attack has a \-4 Accuracy penalty. However, if it hits any wounds it inflicts will automatically be dealt to that location.

## **Holding Back**

Sometimes you are not aiming to kill your opponent, be it because you are in a friendly spar, testing your subordinates or trying to bring back a target alive. Exerting restraint can be a difficult task, and it does have its limits.

In game terms, any time one of your attacks would reduce an opponent below 0 HP (not Vitality, it's on you to stop attacking once they hit HP if you don't want to hurt them), you can instead decide to leave them at 0 HP (Incapacitated).

Additionally, any time you would apply a Major Wound or higher, you can decide to lower the Severity of any Wound you inflict by 1\. You must declare this before you roll for location (or before your opponent chooses it if they were able to do so).

Should it ever matter, this is the last Wound altering effect that needs to be declared by the attacker before resolving the Wound and allowing the Defender to apply any Wound reducing, negating or ignoring effects.

You cannot Hold Back (either of the above effects) with A or B Rank Jutsu, if you do not want to risk accidentally killing or maiming your target, do not use them.

## **Recovery**

Minor wounds all heal at the end of the day (or generally after the scene they were made in ends.
Major wounds require 5 weeks (8 days ooc) to heal or 3 weeks (5 days) while in the hospital.
Severe wounds require 8 weeks (14 days) to heal or 5 weeks  (8 days) while in the hospital.
Critical wounds require 18 weeks (31 days) to heal or 12 weeks (21 days) while in the hospital.

# **Wound Types**

# **Blunt**

[|Minor|](#blunt-minor)
[|Major|](#blunt-major)
[|Severe|](#blunt-severe)
[|Critical|](#blunt-critical)

## **Blunt (Minor)**

### **\- (1 \- 20\) Ringing Noise (Head)**

There's a drumming noise inside your head that starts when... ... uh, right. But, yeah, it's pretty distracting. For 25 IC you get a \-1 penalty to all d20 rolls, aside from Genjutsu defenses; it's \-2. Multiple applications stack and the duration applied by this Wound increases by 5 IC per every time this Wound is applied after the first time.

### **\- (21 \- 40\) Bruised Ribs (Torso)**

As in the bones, not the skin over them. Truth is, ribs hurt a lot more than they have any business doing. Breathing hurts in particular, deep breathing especially so. This increases the Speed of all your actions by 1, similar to Paralysis. This speed is increased by 1 per every time this Wound is applied after the first time. The next time you take the rest action instead of reducing your stamina penalties you may reduce the effects of this wound by the amount you would reduce your stamina penalty.

### **\- (41 \- 60\) Winded (Abdomen)**

A good shot to the gut hit your solar plexus or compressed your diaphragm, or both, knocking the wind out of you. You'll be fine, definitely, but this increases your Stamina penalty by 4 and applies a Stun 4\.

### **\- (61 \- 80\) Bruised (Arm)**

Your arm is bruised. It hurts. This gives a \-1 Accuracy penalty (because of the pain being distracting, if you're attacking without using the arm) and increases your Seal Speeds by 1\. This penalty lasts until the next time you make an attack. Multiple applications of this wound stack and the effect lasts for 1 additional attack per every time this Wound is applied after the first time.

### **\- (81 \- 100\) Bruised (Leg)**

Something hit your leg and now it hurts\! You'll feel better after you walk it off (or just sit down and let the pain fade). Until the end of battle this reduces your base movement speed by 10% and applies a \-1 penalty to dodge rolls. This penalty lasts until the next time you make a dodge roll. Multiple applications of this wound stack and the effect lasts for 1 additional dodge per every time this Wound is applied after the first time.

## **Blunt (Major)**

### **\- (1 \- 20\) Dazed (Head)**

That one left you reeling. Once you're done seeing stars, you'll be... mostly okay. Everything seems just a little bit... off, about the world, though you can't quite place what. Sounds are muffled, colors muted, and things keep moving at the edge of your vision. 

You lose any AP you currently have, and all effects with Upkeeps (other than Doujutsu) end as you lose your concentration. If you're standing on water or a wall, you'll fall, too. This distraction provides a \-1 penalty to all D20 Rolls.

### **\- (21 \- 40\) Collapsed Lung (Torso)**

Your lung quit its day job; unfortunately, that day job was letting you breathe. Your Fatigue rolls have a \-3 penalty; you can live with both lungs collapsed, though that raises the penalty to \-9 (rather than just \-6).

### **\- (41 \- 60\) Groin Shot (Abdomen)**

If this was a called shot, you should probably having a serious talk with your opponent about what constitutes fair fighting. Even ninja have standards\!

It's a Stun 8, and you probably feel more than a little nauseous. Don't be ashamed about doubling over and whimpering, either\! Until it's healed your Agility stat is considered 10% lower for all purposes. On top of that, you have a \-4 penalty to Resistance rolls until your recovery is complete.

### **\- (61 \- 80\) Sprained Arm (Arm)**

Your elbow or wrist was forced to bend in a way it's not meant to by the blow, and sprained in the process. This gives a \-2 penalty to rolls, and Accuracy of attacks, using that arm (such as grapple rolls, grapple TNs, and all two handed weapons). Single-handed weapons held in the other hand, ninjutsu, and taijutsu jutsu which specify they're only kicks suffer only a \-1. It also increases your Seal Speeds by 5\.

### **\- (81 \- 100\) Sprained Leg (Leg)**

The muscles and ligaments in your knee or ankle were stretched beyond their capacity. Any time you move, including dodging, the pain leaves your Accuracy and d20 rolls at a \-2 penalty for the next 15 IC.

## **Blunt (Severe)**

### **\- (1 \- 20\) Concussion (Head)**

Somebody turned out the lights. It is very dark, and you are likely to be eaten by a grue. Thankfully, you get over that before your enemies can capitalize on it (or you're eaten).

This imposes a \-5 penalty on all d20 rolls, and halves (round down) your Current and Maximum AP, and the amount of AP you gain from any source. Whenever you suffer a head wound, you have a 20% chance per level of the wound to be knocked unconscious. Any time this happens, your recovery time is reset.

### **\- (21 \- 40\) Broken Ribs**

You are in horrible, terrible pain. You'd be screaming and/or mewling, if you weren't a ninja\! Breathing feels like you're being stabbed--and depending on how badly broken those ribs are, that might be exactly what's happening.

The effectiveness of blocking is reduced by 30% (from 50% to 20% for most attacks, and 25% to ineffective against weapons), and you have a \-4 penalty to Accuracy and d20 rolls. The Speed of all actions you take is increased by 2\.

### **\- (41 \- 60\) Crushed Organ (Abdomen)**

It's not as bad as it sounds, honestly. There's some severe bleeding and bruising inside the organ itself, and it hurts horrendously, but it's not bleeding out into other parts of your body--meaning it can only possibly get so bad. You receive a Bleed of Severity 8 that resets every time you perform a Stamina or Chakra Check. Your max HP and Vitality are reduced by 20% (and your current values of both by 10% of your maximum), which also affects Wound Thresholds. And you also have a \-5 penalty to Resistance and Athletics rolls.

### **\- (61 \- 80\) Broken Arm (Arm)**

Someone broke your arm, which has left it more or less unusable at present unless there’s a medic-nin nearby who’s willing to take pity on you.

Your arm can't be used in grapples, and you have a \-5 penalty to grapple rolls and grapple TNs. It can't be used to hold two-handed weapons, and attempting to use it for any other sort of taijutsu (unarmed or weapon) incurs a \-5 Accuracy penalty and denies you your damage bonus for that action.

You can still form hand seals, though at a \+5 increase to all Seal Speeds. And when you finish doing so make a Resistance roll with a \-10 penalty against the total Seal Speed; failure means you flinch and fail to perform the Jutsu, you don’t pay the Chakra Cost associated with the Jutsu, but still pay any AP you invested into the Action and move your IC by its Final Speed.

### **\- (81 \- 100\) Broken Leg (Leg)**

Severe damage to your leg has left you with a reduced ability to locomote around the battlefield\! If worst comes to worst, you can still power-hobble on it; it doesn't directly penalize your movement, but moving has a Stun 4 added to it (even moving as part of an attack). Since normal movement is handled IC by IC, this means that the Move Action applies this Stun every IC of movement, and that you can only move 1 IC at a time before receiving a new Stun 4\.

So long as your leg is broken, you can't use any Jutsu or abilities that move you or increase your movement speed and such effects or Jutsu end immediately. Knockback effects are, obviously enough, an exception. This doesn’t apply to effects or Jutsus that grant you flight and you may still use those. Your leg won't get better if you're walking around on it. If you walk with crutches (or a cane, or something of the sort) you can move at only half speed, but it counts as 'rest' for the purpose of recovering from this wound.

## **Blunt (Critical)**

### **\- (1 \- 20\) Fractured Skull (Head)**

You got hit in the head hard enough that you're lucky you don't have (much) brain damage. This will usually be accompanied by nasty lacerations and prolific bleeding, but not always.

Aside from a Stun 15, you suffer a \-8 penalty to accuracy and all d20 rolls, doubled for skill checks. And your maximum AP pool becomes 0\.

Until this heals any time you suffer a Head Wound, of any type or severity, roll 1d20. On 1 \- 10, you suffer the wound normally. On a roll of 11 \- 20, you're unconscious and comatose until that wound fully heals (even if that takes longer than it does for your Fractured Skull to finish healing). You'll always be comatose for a minimum of 24 hours, even for a Minor head wound.

### **\- (21 \- 40\) Sternal Fracture (Torso)**

Your sternum is that rather lengthy, thoroughly sturdy piece of bone and cartilage that runs down the middle of your chest that all your ribs connect to. They're pretty hard to break. Nice job pulling that one off.

This in itself isn't terribly bad, but whatever hit you with enough force to do that off also managed to break several ribs and cause some significant internal damage. It's pretty easy to tell your chest is just about ruined: there's a grinding sound of bone on bone whenever you breathe or try to move too much, for one thing; the agonizing pain's a pretty good hint, too.

This imposes a \-15 penalty on all Fatigue checks, and reduces your Damage Bonuses by half. It also imposes a \-8 penalty on all Defensive rolls.

### **\- (41 \- 60\) Rupture (Abdomen)**

Your abdomen's important because it's full of all sorts of squishy parts that are pretty important for your continued survival. Whatever kind of trauma you just went through ruptured one of those squishy bits, and now it's bleeding out all over your insides. Yes, blood belongs inside you, but... not actually inside your abdominal cavity.

Every time you act, including movement, you lose HP (not Vitality) equal to twice the Speed of the action, and an additional 1 HP every 2 IC. In theory, this could even Wound you again. Treating this with First Aid requires a Medicine Check of a TN of 40, and generally involves cutting open the victim's abdomen and letting it drain (or, in rare cases, ventilate) before figuring out what's actually bleeding and making it stop. It's a Speed 25 action to treat this Wound, but it stops the persistent HP loss.

Any time you take an action, you have a 5\*(action's Speed)% chance of causing the injury to act up again, bringing back all its lovely effects and requiring treatment (via First Aid or actual medical treatment) to bring it back under control again. 

### **\- (61 \- 80\) Shattered Arm (Arm)**

Your arm is so broken that the breaks have breaks. It's useless. You can't perform handseals, hold weapons or use items with it, and so forth. The pain is horrible and makes it virtually impossible to concentrate, imposing a \-8 penalty to d20 rolls and Accuracy, and a \-4 penalty to Fatigue checks.

### **\- (81 \- 100\) Shattered Leg (Leg)**

There are broken legs, there are severely broken legs, and then there's your leg. You can't stand without something to prop you up, but because you're a tough-as-nails and super resourceful ninja you can still move, though the distance you move is divided by 4\. You have a \-10 penalty to Dodge, and \-5 to other d20 rolls.

Also forget about using any Jutsu or powers that move you or allow you to move, you plainly cannot. 

Once you've had two weeks of medical treatment and been put in a splint, you can walk. So long as you carry a crutch, cane, or walking stick (which does occupy a hand), you can move at half speed, and suffer only halve the above penalties. You can do so without out, though each time you take any action which requires you to move (including dodging), or are hit, you have a 50% chance of your leg giving out, and suffering all the regular penalties.

# **Slashing**

[|Minor|](#slashing-minor)
[|Major|](#slashing-major)
[|Severe|](#slashing-severe)
[|Critical|](#slashing-critical)

## **Slashing (Minor)**

### **\- (1 \- 20\) Profuse Bleeding (Head)**

You got a gash on your face, maybe a slice into your cheek. You’re bleeding a lot\! Head injuries are like that. The blood loss isn’t the issue; the fact that that blood is running over your face and getting in your mouth is. As your mouth fills with blood, it becomes progressively harder to breathe (and not vomit). You’re inflicted with a Bleed 2 and a Suffocate 1 until the Bleed ends. Every time you gain this Wound again after the first time during this Combat encounter, the Bleed increases by \+2 and the suffocate increases by \+1 (Bleed 4, Suffocate 2 the second time, Bleed 6, Suffocate 3 the third time, etc).

### **\- (21 \- 40\) Pulmonary Gnash (Torso)**

Something managed to cut through your pectoral muscle and between your ribs to nick your lung. A pretty impressive feat, but if they were a real badass they would get your heart (be sure to taunt them about that). This inflicts a Bleed effect of 3\*Fatigue Level at the time of acquiring this Wound, minimum 3\. Luckily it’s a deep but narrow injury, so it tends to heal fairly quickly. 

### **\- (41 \- 60\) Sliced Stomach (Abdomen)**

This is what happens when you can't make your body concave enough. You get cut right across the belly. Fortunately it isn't that bad, it's just in a bad spot. You take a Bleed 2, and have a \-2 to all Fatigue rolls until the Bleed ends. Every time you gain this Wound again after the first time during this Combat encounter, the Bleed increases by \+2 and the Fatigue penalty increases by \+1 (Bleed 4, \-3 Fatigue penalty the second time, Bleed 6, \-4 Fatigue penalty the third time, etc).

### **\- (61 \- 80\) Lacerated (Arm)**

You got a nasty gash running along your arm. It didn't cut anything vital, but blood is seeping down your arm and off your fingertips. You’re inflicted with a Bleed 2, and have \-1 to Accuracy and \+2 to all Seal Speeds until the Bleed ends. Every time you gain this Wound again after the first time during this Combat encounter, the Bleed increases by \+2 and the Accuracy and Seal Speed penalties increase by \+1 (Bleed 4, \-2 Accuracy and \+3 Seal Speeds penalty the second time, Bleed 6, \-3 Accuracy and \+4 Seal Speeds penalty the third time, etc).

### **\- (81 \- 100\) Lacerated (Leg)**

You got a nasty gash running along your leg. It's not life threatening, but it is staining your clothes and oozing down your leg. You’re inflicted with a Bleed 2, and have \-1 to Defensive Rolls until the Bleed ends. Every time you gain this Wound again after the first time during this Combat encounter, the Bleed increases by \+2 and the Defensive Rolls penalty increases by \+1 (Bleed 4, \-2 Defensive rolls penalty the second time, Bleed 6, \-3 Defensive Rolls penalty the third time, etc).

## **Slashing (Major)**

### **\- (1 \- 20\) Blood in the Eyes (Head)**

Oh no you’re bleeding from the face! Because fights must be dramatic, the attack has cut in such a way (maybe right across your eyelid, maybe over the forehead) that blood is now dripping into one of your eyes, causing a continual distraction. You take a Bleed 1 and \-1 Visibility Penalty and every 20 ICs in combat you gain it again but increasing both by 1, stacking up to Bleed 4 and \-4 Visibility. After reaching Bleed 4 it stops reapplying but you retain the \-4 visibility penalty. You can take a Speed 5 Action to wipe away the blood, resetting the Visibility penalties (which will return as normal in 15 IC). Using a first aid kit prevents you from accruing any Visibility Penalty from this wound in combat, but applies its own \-2 Visibility Penalty as you have to cover the eye.

### **\- (21 \- 40\) Armor Tear (Torso)**

Something managed to slice right across your chest, hacking chunks of your flesh and armor right off your body. On top of being a fairly nasty gash which is likely to scar if not given stitches, you’re inflicted with a Bleed 4, and your DR is reduced by 10\. This can potentially take you down to negative values, in which case, the negative DR acts as a static Damage boost any Attack against you will receive. Your Torso armor also takes a \-25% of its maximum Durability to its Current Durability, though your clothing beneath is still intact (Gotta keep things PG 13). 

### **\- (41 \- 60\) Open Cavity (Abdomen)**

Your abdominal cavity--the part of your body that holds all your abdominal organs in together in a nice, safe environment--has been opened, and it really wasn't meant to be.

You can no longer Rest and gain an irreducible upkeep 2. Additionally the penalty you incur from passing a Stamina or Chakra Exhaustion roll is increased by 1.

### **\- (61 \- 80\) Muscle Tear (Arm)**

Your bicep and/or tricep have been partially torn, which tends to make it a lot harder to function effectively in combat, as your arm goes from a dry noodle to a limp one.

You take Bleed 4, and Your STR is reduced by 10%. This affects everything derived from your STR score you're hoping it doesn't (Vitality, Damage Bonus, damage dice with taijutsu, etc).

### **\- (81 \- 100\) Muscle Tear (Leg)**

Your quadriceps have been torn. Not to fear, the tendon is fine and you haven't been hamstrung, you're not going to be put down like an animal (though this should teach you to treat pets better).

You take Bleed 4, and your AGI is reduced by 10%. This affects everything derived from your AGI score you're hoping it doesn't (Dodge, Initiative, max AP, movement speed).

## **Slashing (Severe)**

### **\- (1 \- 20\) Avulsed Ear (Head)**

You have a nasty cut right across your ear\! Not only does this look pretty brutal, but there's blood seeping into your inner ear, which can do some nasty things to your sense of coordination.

If you have the Enhanced Hearing ability, you lose all benefits from it, as well as any abilities which depend on it (such as Blind Fighting). With blood pooling in the ear making it difficult to keep your sense of balance, the highest level of Taijutsu you can perform is reduced by one (From A to B, B to C, C to D/etc).

You're also treated as being in the Fatigue category higher than you actually are for the purpose of penalties (but not benefits), meaning that if you're at Fatigue 1, you have a \-2 to Accuracy and \-4 to Defensive rolls, instead of the normal \-1/-2. Under normal circumstances, this means you also fall unconscious at 1 fatigue less than normal.

The blood can be drained from the ear easily with medical attention, but can't be treated in battle. 

**\- (21 \- 40\) Clavicle Cut (Torso)**

The horizontal bone that connects your sternum to your scapula has been fractured. More than likely, it's possible you can even feel part of the bone that's jutting out from the skin, if you try to look down at it.

The worst part of it is the pain, which can't really be avoided because of how the clavicle helps the scapula keep in position to let the arm hang. This inflicts a \-5 to Accuracy and d20 rolls, and a Paralysis 4\. Any time you perform an action with a Stamina cost or a Seal Speed, you take four times that amount in damage, which bypasses reductions (such as DR).

Crash course in anatomy, you have two clavicles. If the result was odd, it's your right; even, your left. With proper medical attention (a trip to a doctor, or a Medicine roll of 20 or higher using a First Aid kit, you or someone else) you can get the arm completely immobilized against your body. This reduces the Paralysis to 2, and halves the damage taken when you make Stamina rolls, but means you cannot use that arm or hand at all.

### **\- (41 \- 60\) Chopped Liver (Abdomen)**

Your liver has been cut. There's really no good side to this one, it pretty much sucks. The liver happens to have quite a few functions, namely helping against toxins and the digestion of proteins. It's kind of vital to live, and it happens to be bleeding out at a very significant rate.

This applies a Bleed 10 effect. Whenever you take an action with a Speed greater than the severity of your current Bleed from this wound (even if it's gone down to Bleed 0), the Bleed's severity increases by 5\.

This also impedes your body's ability to process chemicals properly. The Severity (And not any other of the Poison’s effects) of any Poisons you're suffering from are doubled. And If you're under the effects of a Soldier or Blood Pill, they end immediately (including the reduction of a Fatigue level, which can knock you unconscious). Taking either pill or any Antidotes with this wound results in no beneficial effect taking place. The Akimichi Clan's Pills and Hakubai Clan's Chemicals and other similar products do not work either.

### **\- (61 \- 80\) Hand of Benediction (Arm)**

No, the name's not a joke, and I have no idea why you think it would be. It's a real term\!

Somehow, the median nerve around the elbow has been severed, resulting in a loss of proper hand function. It doesn't hurt that much since it was a nerve that was struck, but your pinky and ring fingers are no longer able to be felt or manipulated at all, and your thumb is more or less unopposable.

For starters, if you had anything in your hand at the time (evens for left, odds for right), you're automatically disarmed. The same is true for any two-handed weapon you might be holding. You can not wield a weapon in that hand, and any unarmed attacks made with the affected limb only receive half your Damage Bonus.

Your DEX is reduced by \-25% and Seal Speeds are increased by 50%. Additionally whenever you make a Ninjutsu or Taijutsu Ranged Attack, roll a 1d6, on a roll of 1 you miss automatically as your arm spasms, ruining your aim (Even if you were using the other arm to do the Attack). You can avoid the increase in Seal Speed by performing your seals one handed, using the opposite hand--if you're able to do so.

### **\- (81 \- 100\) Hamstrung (Leg)**

One of the major tendons of the leg, located behind the femur, have been cut. You're now unable to walk or stand properly, more or less, and running is completely out of the equation.

You're automatically Prone, as if tripped (See the E-rank Taijutsu for its penalties), and your AGI bonus to Dodge is now AGI/20. You can stand up, but every time you perform a Dodge Interrupt or the “Move with an Attack” Maneuver, you fall Prone again. You can still use jutsu to increase your rate of movement, or to even move you, but the total distance moved is halved.

You no longer benefit from the Active ability, and your AP cap is now AGI/4. Any Athletics rolls you make use only half of your total ranks in the skill.

If you manage to survive the fight which caused this (props for that, since you're a sitting duck.)

## **Slashing (Critical)**

### **\- (1 \- 20\) Cut Throat (Head)**

The good news: you were not beheaded. The bad news: They didn't fail by much. Your carotid artery was hit, along with your trachea, which means blood is flying all over the place and you're going to suffocate from it if you don't do something smart (like surrender, or run away).

You start with a Suffocation 2\. Every time you take an action with a Speed greater than 2, its severity is increased by 1 (notably, the "Move" action will not trigger this effect). However, instead of making a Stamina 15 roll every time your Suffocation increases (as you would with a normal Suffocation status), you make such a roll every 10 IC. This follows all other normal rules for Suffocation.

Additionally, you suffer a Bleed Status with a Severity equal to triple that of the Suffocation. In the case of special abilities which reduce the effect of the Suffocation status on you, the Bleed's severity is determined before they're applied.

Treatment with a First Aid kit will set the Suffocation penalty to 0; however, this will not prevent it from increasing again. In fact, nothing will at all until you've recovered from the wound\! Ouch. On the bright side, you're a super implausible magic ninja. If you carefully apply pressure to your neck with both hands, you can temporarily suspend both the Suffocation rolls and the Bleed damage--though you may take no other actions while doing this, not even Speed 0 ones. This 'suspension' applies after you've been doing it for at least 10 consecutive IC.

This is really just nasty business, all things considered. It won't start healing until it's received some medical treatment; after that, as long as you keep your neck bandaged and let yourself rest.

### **\- (21 \- 40\) Injured Spine (Torso)**

In simple terms, your spinal cord is a part of your central nervous system and relays signals from the body to the brain, and vice versa. It also has several neural circuits which control numerous reflexes and "instinctual" actions that ninja tend to train themselves for (like moving out of the way of the technique that caused this).

Fortunately for you, your reflexes didn't seem to be that crucial anyway, since you let this happen, so you probably aren't that bad off. Well, that's a lie. Whenever you take any Action or Interrupt, two things happen.

The first is that you suffer a Stun equal to its Speed. The second is that you acquire a Paralysis 1 status, or increase your existing Paralysis from this wound by 1\. The Paralysis lasts until the end of the battle.

This will not heal without medical treatment. 

**\- (41 \- 60\) Disemboweled (Abdomen)**

Congratulations, you've got what is potentially the most terrible injury one can receive. Your abdomen is full of all kinds of squishy organs and things which, as it turns out, are pretty important to keep you alive. Now there's a giant cut across your midriff and they're all trying to sag out of your body.

You have a Bleed 20\. Your Fatigue penalties are doubled (-2 to Accuracy and \-4 to defensive rolls per level), and you gain no bonuses from Fatigue Levels (No \+5 to Stamina and CE Checks per Fatigue Level). Any jutsu with an Upkeep cannot be used, as it's impossible to maintain the necessary level of focus.

Until you've received treatment for this, any Called Shots (It has to be a Called Shot) to your abdomen automatically deal double their Damage to your HP (Not Vitality).

Every time you advance a Fatigue level after receiving this wound, it takes another week to recover from.

### **\- (61 \- 80\) Avulsed Arm (Arm)**

Something just cut through a good portion of your arm. It's still connected, but it's kind of flopping, and you can't really control it, and it's kind of bleeding everywhere, and.. Yeah. Firstly, the arm is useless, which means you can't hold weapons (if you are,  you drop them), make handseals, use items and so forth. You have a Bleed 12 that won’t get reduced, \-8 to Accuracy, and \-4 to defensive rolls and Athletics. And you only benefit from half your DBs. Every time you perform an attack which deals damage, your Bleed status from this wound increases by your DB/2, to a minimum of 1\.

### **\- (81 \- 100\) Achilles Tendon Cut (Leg)**

Named after a mythic, nigh-invincible man who supposedly had a single tendon as his weak spot. As it turns out, that's actually a weak spot of everybody, and yours just got cut. The pain isn't quite as bad as the sight of your foot dragging along unresponsively. For starters, you take a Bleed 15 that won’t get reduced and you're unable to really stand properly, so you take a \-8 to your Dodge rolls and Athletics, and a \-4 to Accuracy.

The worst part is that you really just can't move. You can't move as part of an attack or use jutsu that affects movement (like Shunshin). You can still take a move action, but at that point you're more so just rolling and crawling, so the total distance moved is divided by 4, after all other factors are applied to it. You can still 'move' to get out of the way of Area of Effect attacks (determine AoE dodge penalties), but it suffers the same /4 as regular movement.

# **Piercing**

[|Minor|](#piercing-minor)
[|Major|](#piercing-major)
[|Severe|](#piercing-severe)
[|Critical|](#piercing-critical)

## **Needling**

Needling is a status effect unique to Piercing Wounds. Every Piercing Wound will inflict some amount of Needling, which represents the slow, steady pain and debilitating effect of being stabbed full of holes. Needling, accordingly, fully stacks with itself. One or two you can typically bear without too much trouble (assuming they don’t go through you), but the more puncture wounds you take, the harder it becomes to have those bursts of energy that ninja depend upon to get an edge on their opponents. Needling reduces the maximum size of your AP pool by its severity (other sources of AP gain, such as Gates, are unaffected by this), and will cause you to lose any AP you might have had if your maximum AP cap is brought below your current AP. Every time you gain AP, you first reduce it by your Needling Status (Potentially to 0), then reduce your Needling Severity by the amount the AP gain was reduced by: If you had a Needling 6 status effect, and gained 8 APs, you would reduce your Needling status to 0 (returning your AP pool to its normal maximum) and then gain 2 AP (rather than 8).

## **Piercing (Minor)**

### **\- (1 \- 30\) Incision (Torso)**

You've got a small but fairly deep incision from what struck you. The initial shock of pain was worse than the wound really is, though. You take a Stun 3, which increases by 2 for every time you take this wound in the same battle. And gain Needling 2\.

### **\- (31 \- 60\) Flesh Wound (Abdomen)**

You've been shanked in the gut. It managed to miss your vitals, but it's still going to cause blood to trickle out of you. You take a Needling 4 and a \-1 to Fatigue Checks for so long as you have any Needling Status.

### **\- (61 \- 80\) Reflexive Flinch (Arm)**

The back of your hand was hit, causing your fingers to spasm momentarily. Any weapons you're holding are dropped, and any seals you're forming are automatically aborted. You take Needling 3 and a \-1 to Accuracy for so long as you have any Needling Status. The Accuracy penalty applied by this Wound increases by \-1 per every time this Wound is applied after the first time.

### **\- (81 \- 100\) Muscle Stab (Leg)**

They struck your quadricep, which is a fairly easy target, all things considered. If you've moved in the past 15 ICs before receiving this Wound, then you receive a Stun 8; whether you were moving or not, though, you take Needling 3 and a \-1 to Defensive rolls for so long as you have any Needling Status. The Defensive rolls penalty applied by this Wound increases by \-1 per every time this Wound is applied after the first time.

## **Piercing (Major)**

### **\- (1 \- 30\) Punctured Cavity (Torso)**

The body has several cavities, areas where specific internal organs are housed and kept together. One of them has been pierced and now has a hole in it, inflicting Needling 5. What’s worse is that every injury you take afterward causes your body to naturally tense up, aggravating the injury and causing noticeable pain, causing any future Needling status effect gained while you have this wound to also inflict an equivalent amount of Stun. 

### **\- (31 \- 60\) Organ Hemorrhage (Abdomen)**

Your abdomen happens to have several internal organs all closely packed together. While space-saving, it also happens to mean that if you're hit there, one of them is bound to be injured in some form or fashion, and that's exactly what happened. What that boils down to is that you're bleeding. A lot. You take Needling 6 and Bleed 4, and your Bleed will not be reduced until your Needling Severity reaches 0\.

### **\- (61 \- 80\) Joint Pierced (Arm)**

One of your arm's joints has been struck and is now filling with blood and becoming inflamed. It makes it much harder to properly manipulate the appendage, on top of the very strange and unnerving sensation you get when you move the arm and can feel the collected blood sloshing around.

You take Needling 4 and from now on, you will have a Paralysis Status Condition of a Severity equal to (Needling/5).

### **\- (81 \- 100\) Joint Pierced (Leg)**

Though they missed fracturing your knee cap, they still managed to pierce the joint itself, and it's now collecting (and leaking) blood which isn't supposed to be there. Like many wounds, on its own it isn't so bad, but when aggravated, it becomes very problematic.

You take Needling 5 and receive a penalty to your movement speed equal to (Needling \* 3)%. Finally, this Wound applies a \-1 penalty to defensive rolls for every 15% it reduces your movement speed.

## **Piercing (Severe)**

### **\- (1 \- 30\) Rib Spearing (Torso)**

The object that struck you did so in such a way as to cause your ribs not just to fracture, but to split entirely. Both ends are curved inward, making movement, breathing, and life in general very painful.

You take a Needling 8, and a \-4 to Accuracy, Fatigue, and d20 rolls just for having your ribs broken. Additionally, every time you fail a Fatigue Check, or spend Willpower, or take a Torso or Abdomen Wound, you take the Minor Piercing Wound Incision. This stacks cumulatively with any other Incision Wounds taken in the fight, for determining the severity of its Stun and Needling.

### **\- (31 \- 60\) Cavitation (Abdomen)**

Cavitation is an interesting phenomena typically only created by high velocity projectiles. Ninja being ninja, of course, means that this could happen with even the most inconspicuous of objects.

What Cavitation is, is basically a wave of pressure that forces things--in your case, your internal organs--to shift in location, causing a cavity where there was none. It results in your organs being crushed, missshapen, tearing, and dislocated. This is especially problematic for the abdomen, wherein everything is already densely packed. There is, shall we say, a space issue.

The end result is that you receive Needling 6 and you automatically advance a fatigue category, and the category at which you fall unconscious is reduced by one (from six to five, normally, meaning if you fail a fatigue roll at fatigue 4, you fall unconscious).

The only good part about this injury is that once your organs are displaced--well, they're displaced. If you are already suffering from this injury and are unlucky enough to have it happen again, you advance a fatigue category, but the category for unconsciousness is not lowered more than once, regardless of how many times you suffer this wound.

### **\- (61 \- 80\) Tricep Tear (Arm)**

They missed your humerus bone, but managed to pierce right through the tendon that connected a portion of your tricep to it. As any medically-savvy ninja knows, your tricep is pretty vital for doing things like punching, and holding objects.

You take Needling 8, If you're using a weapon, then your damage bonus is halved; unarmed only has its damage bonus reduced by a fourth. You take a \-5 to Accuracy, but against disarm attempts, this increases to \-10 (whether you try to parry or dodge it).

Tendons are tricky business, and require medical expertise to fix. Without medical attention, it won't heal; with it, it takes six weeks.

### **\- (81 \- 100\) Hamstrung (Leg)**

Your hamstring, or some similarly important muscle in your leg, got cut badly enough that it's not doing its job any more. You can stand, barely, and you can balance, sort of.

You take Needling 10\. You can only accomplish 10 IC of movement before having to take a Rest action. Movement as part of an attack counts towards this limit. Any effects which require you to channel chakra through your legs (such as standing on walls or water, or jutsu such as Mizutamari) end, and cannot be used until you've healed.

## **Piercing (Critical)**

### **\- (1 \- 30\) Punctured Lung (Torso)**

Okay, so, first off, calm down. It's not as bad as it... okay, yeah, it's as bad as it sounds. The good news is, it's not actually lethal. You've still got the other one (...right?) and whatever did this to you probably ventilated the lung, and by extension, the inside of your chest--no air building up in your chest cavity to collapse the other lung.

...Ready for the bad news? Yeah, lungs aren't actually meant to get ventilated. You have difficulty breathing, for one thing. In fact, you can't actually breathe normally, because there's an extra hole in your lung. Still, you're a super awesome ninja, and as long as you have one hand free to cover the wound up, you can still breathe.

You receive Needling 15, can't take Rest actions, and the final results of your Stamina rolls are halved. As in, if you have a 12+5+15 \= 32, that's actually a 16\. Probably less brutal, you have a \-6 penalty to your Accuracy and d20 rolls from the agonizing pain, and a \-5 penalty to Chakra Exhaustion rolls due to general poor physical condition. Moving any distance forces a roll of Stamina 10, \+1 per yard moved; this even applies when moving as part of an attack or with the aid of a jutsu. This can be avoided by moving at one tenth your normal movement speed.

Oh, unless you get your second lung punctured before the first one's healed. Then you just die after 50 IC have passed. Sucks to be to you

### **\- (31 \- 60\) Pierced Liver (Abdomen)**

You're bleeding from the midsection. And, the blood is black. Every ninja knows at least a little about anatomy, first aid, and injuries, and everyone ninja knows what black blood means: you're bleeding from the liver and about to die.

This inflicts you with Needling 10 and a Poison 1 effect. 20 IC later, it doubles to Poison 2; another 20 IC, and it doubles to Poison 4, then 8, then 16, etc.... You get the picture. If treated with a First Aid kit, make a Medicine check. Its effects (Both the Poison Damage and the Poison doubling) will be held at bay for 1 hour per point above TN 25 you get on your skill roll. You may only make such a Medicine Checks once per Hour. Once you've received a week of medical treatment, this stops being necessary.

However, any time you advance a Fatigue level you have an 75% chance of reopening the wound and reactivating the Poison Damage.

**\- (61 \- 80\) Shoulder Orifice (Arm)**

Someone has created another orifice in your body. As in--if there wasn't blood pouring out from both ends--someone could look right through your shoulder and see what's out the other side. In Pain is an understatement.

On top of that, your arm is pretty much worthless. It's still there, muscular (or toned, for the ladies\!) and attached and awesome, but it's not doing anything but helping to keep your clothing on, at this point. You're not really able to feel anything that the arm or hand happens to touch, and the only way you get it to do so is by flopping it against something as dead weight.

You take Needling 10 and lose the usage of your arm. If you don't have single handed seals, you can not make seals anymore. You have a \-6 Accuracy penalty, can't use two-handed weapons, and halve your Damage Bonus for Unarmed and One Handed Weapon Attacks, and obviously you can't use it to grapple. Oh and when you multi-throw the total number of weapons you can throw is halved.

When you're first hit, this inflicts a Bleed 15 which will go away normally.

### **\- (81 \- 100\) Penetrated Artery (Leg)**

Your femoral artery has been hit, and blood is literally spraying out of you into the air. Aside from the general pain involved and the fact that it's completely disgusting, you're losing a potentially fatal amount of blood and if it isn't stopped--no, a hand and some pressure won't stop this--you're going to die.

You take Needling 10 and your maximum Vitality is reduced by 10%. Every time you take an action, your current and maximum Vitality are reduced by (that action's base Speed)\*2; every time you spend AP, your current and maximum Vitality are reduced by (AP spent). For this Wound, losing AP gained due to the Needling Status counts as spending it. 

If you have 0 Vitality remaining, your current HP, maximum HP, and maximum Vitality are all reduced by that amount. This includes move actions, unless you move at only one tenth your normal speed. If your maximum Hit Points are reduced to 0, you die.

At that point, you begin regaining lost maximum HP and Vitality. Every week which passes you regain (RES)/2 max HP, or (RES) with medical attention and half that in vitality. Once your max HP is fully restored, you begin gaining lost maximum Vitality at the same rate

# **Energy**

[|Minor|](#energy-minor)
[|Major|](#energy-major)
[|Severe|](#energy-severe)
[|Critical|](#energy-critical)

## **Energy (Minor)}**

### **\- (1 \- 20\) Sun Spots (Head)**

You were a little too slow in closing your eyes when hit, and now vague shapes resembling the oncoming blast seem to float around in front of you, obscuring your vision. It's annoying, more than anything else. You’re inflicted with a Burn 2, and a \-2 Visibility penalty that lasts until the Burn status ends. Every time you gain this Wound again after the first time during this Combat encounter, the Burn increases by \+1 and the Visibility penalty increases by \-1 (Burn 3, \-3 Visibility penalty the second time, Burn 4, \-4 Visibility penalty the third time, etc).

### **\- (21 \- 40\) Flash Fever (Torso)**

The center of your body was hit, which is good, since it's intended to take the brunt of attacks. But whatever hit you also managed to heat you up so much that your body is having trouble regulating your temperature. You feel vaguely sick and tired, but you'll shake it off soon. You’re inflicted with a Burn 2, and have a \-1 to Fatigue rolls until the Burn ends.  Every time you gain this Wound again after the first time during this Combat encounter, the Burn increases by \+1 and the Fatigue penalty increases by \-1 (Burn 3, \-2 Fatigue penalty the second time, Burn 4, \-3 Fatigue penalty the third time, etc)..

### **\- (41 \- 60\) Stomach Blister (Abdomen)**

A pretty nasty blister managed to emerge from whatever hit you, causing plasma to be stuck within a layer of skin that expanded. It's.. gross, and uncomfortably distracting.  You have a \-2 penalty to all d20 rolls until the end of the fight, unless you decide to pop the blister as a Speed 6 action (Seriously--ew), taking a fourth of the damage that caused this injury again. This additional damage can't cause a wound itself.

### **\- (61 \- 80\) Burned (Arm)**

You've been burned\! It hurts. The skin is red and starting to swell a little, and touching it (or having it touched) tends to hurt, as it's now raw. You’re inflicted with a Burn 3, and every time you perform Hand Seals or Taijutsu Attack that involves using your arms (Weapons, Unarmed, Grappling), you take unreducible Damage to your Vitality (And only Vitality) equal to twice the Speed of the Attack or the Seal Speed of the Jutsu. 

### **\- (81 \- 100\) Burned (Leg)**

You've been burned\! Seriously, it does hurt. Your leg is red and it's painful when you put your weight on it trying to do things like run. You’re inflicted with a Burn 2, and have a \-1  Immobilization penalty until the Burn ends.  Every time you gain this Wound again after the first time during this Combat encounter, the Burn increases by \+1 and the Immobilization penalty increases by \-1 (Burn 3, \-2 Immobilization penalty the second time, Burn 4, \-3 Immobilization penalty the third time, etc). 

## **Energy (Major)**

### **\- (1 \- 20\) Facial Burn (Head)**

There's now a nasty burn across your face, the flesh blistered and somewhat charred. This is disorienting, and you can't get the smell of burnt flesh out of your nostrils, or the taste out of your mouth, when you inhale, which has the effect of nauseating you whenever you try to breathe deeply.

As you exert yourself, you smell it more and more and become progressively sicker. Every time you make a Stamina or Chakra roll, you increase your penalty to both by 2\.

### **\- (21 \- 40\) Scorched Chest (Torso)**

The majority of your body has been burned, taking any hair found on your chest, back, and stomach along with it. Due to the large surface area that entails, it isn't that deep at any point, but since it covers so much area, it makes it very easy for others to aggravate your injury.

You have Burn 6 and take an additional 20% Total Damage when hit, after all normal reductions but before determining if you suffer wounds. One of the worst parts about it is how it tends to make getting additional wounds that much easier.

### **\- (41 \- 60\) Scalded Stomach (Abdomen)**

Whatever hit you managed to more or less burn away what covered your midriff and had enough power behind it to significantly heat up your internal organs. This is not good, as your organs can be pretty sensitive about that kind of thing.

You are afflicted with a Burn 6 and Stun 8, and have your current and maximum Hit Points and Vitality reduced by your RES until this has healed.

### **\- (61 \- 80\) Second Degree Burn (Arm)**

The majority of your arm is burned. While not life threatening, the amount of skin that's been burned is substantial, making it a great deal more painful to use the arm in battle.

When you perform handseals, attack, do a grapple jutsu, or parry, you take twice the base Speed and/or Seal Speed of the action as damage, which bypasses reductions (such as DR). In addition, you have Burn 6 and a \-2 to Accuracy.

### **\- (81 \- 100\) Second Degree Burn (Leg)**

One of your legs has been burned down to the dermis, the layer beneath the epidermis, causing multiple small blisters to form at the surface, which has reddened and toughened considerably.

You have a \-5 Immobilization penalty, along with a Burn 6\. When the Burn status is removed, the Immobilization penalty is reduced to \-3.

## **Energy (Severe)**

### **\- (1 \- 20\) Blinded (Head)**

You kept your eyes open a little too long when something was aimed right at your face. Just like with it being a bad idea to look directly into the sun, it is also a bad plan to stare directly at a superheated jutsu aimed at your head. Your face as a whole was scalded, but your eyes took the worst of it by looking at it for so long.

You take a \-3 Visibility Penalty, which is reduced by 1 every 15 IC. It is not so bad by itself, until the next time you're hit by a jutsu that inflicts Energy wounds (regardless of whether or not it does, in fact, actually wound you).

When that happens, your Visibility penalty is increased by 1 \+ 1 per rank of the jutsu (2 for E, 4 for C, etc.), to a maximum of \-8. The technique must deal damage to trigger this effect of the wound.

### **\- (21 \- 40\) Dark Halo (Torso)**

The name comes from the fact that you've suffered burns of the entire dermis in a solid, unbroken ring around your body. It is not quite as cool as it sounds--burns of such magnitude can actually cut off circulation to the rest of the body.

In short, you're going into shock. At the start, it is not so bad, You have Burn 8 and reduce the bonus to CE/Stm rolls from Fatigue by 1 (from \+5 to \+4). Every time your Fatigue increases, however, the bonus lowers by one per level. Thus, if you were at Fatigue 3 when you received this wound, then went up to Fatigue 5 in the same battle, you'd have only \+2 to Chakra Exhaustion and Stamina rolls per Fatigue category (for a total of \+10 at Fatigue 5).

### **\- (41 \- 60\) Side Burns (Abdomen)**

The sides of your ribcage have been charred and are almost black, hence the name that resembles a much less gruesome looking hairstyle (though, let's be honest, it's still pretty bad). Aside from making the definition of your ribcage more obvious, it also makes it harder to breathe.

It isn't so bad here and there, but that quick, almost gasping inhale taken when you try to spur yourself onward makes you pause and lose your breath, slowing you down when you want to be at your quickest.

Whenever you spend AP in combat, you must first pay an additional amount of AP equal to your current Fatigue level, \+1. This surcharge does not affect the action's Speed, pay any costs associate with it, or otherwise count in any beneficial manner. It does, however, count against any penalties or limitations regarding spending AP you may have.

Every time you spend more than your max Willpower in AP on an action (including the surcharge from this wound), you are afflicted with a Suffocation 1\. This Suffocation penalty persists for the duration of the fight, but resets to 0 after 1 Hour of rest.

### **\- (61 \- 80\) Muscle Melting (Arms)**

Not quite as literal as the name implies, but no less serious an injury--you've been burned so deep that he muscle itself has been affected. Aside from intense pain, it also weakens the muscle as a substantial section of it has become damaged and useless.

Your damage bonuses (Physical and Ninjutsu) are lowered by 30%, and you have a \-4 penalty to Accuracy. As you continually use the muscles and chakra involved, the heat builds and spreads to worsen the injury, inflicting even more damage to both muscles and tenketsu.

Whenever you deal damage, the Damage Bonus which was used is lowered by an additional 10% (Add it to the previous percentages), to a minimum of 100% reduction (Essentially removing all Damage Bonus from Attack). When either reaches 50%, 70%, and 90%, your Accuracy for both is lowered by an additional 1 point.

### **\- (81 \- 100\) Fused Foot (Leg)**

The skin of one of your feet (odds right, evens left) has been burned so badly that the toes are more or less a singular section, melted together. The rest of it isn't much better, but the most pressing issue how it impairs its functions in battle.

You have a \-5 to dodges due to how hard it is to adequately shift your weight and pivot using that leg now. It actually makes turning into and away from blows more difficult, imposing a \-3 penalty to Parries. This also makes it substantially harder to run effectively, causing you to lose the benefits of any effects which increase your AGI for the sole purpose of movement (such as the Runner ability, or Racing Thunder Technique), and halving your movement speed on top of that.

## **Energy (Critical)**

### **\- (1 \- 20\) Eye Welded Shut (Head)**

You got hit in the face by a giant fireball or bolt of lightning, which is basically awful for tons of reasons. Aside from the deep-tissue burns across half your face, the heat was enough to melt the surface of one of your eyelids, fusing it shut.

Any ranks in the Enhanced Sight are lost until you recover, as are any abilities dependant upon it. That eye is effectively useless, putting you at a \-5 visibility penalty as well.

It gets worse. The movements of your eyes are linked; where one goes, the other follows, meaning that while one of your eyes is slightly damaged and basically glued by molten flesh to your eyelid, it's still trying to move around, aggravating the injury further.

Every 10 IC which pass, you suffer a \-1 penalty to Accuracy, Fatigue rolls, and defensive rolls, with a maximum of \-10. However, if you close both your eyes these penalties are reduced by 1 every 5 IC (though be aware that closing both eyes incurs a \-10 visibility penalty), to a minimum of half the highest value it's reached (if it got up to \-7, closing your eyes couldn't reduced it below \-4).

### **\- (21 \- 40\) Atrial Fibrillation (Torso)**

The burns to your chest are so deep and severe that they're affecting your cardiovascular system. Specifically, the heart, and the rhythm at which it beats. Thankfully, this is the less lethal form of fibrillation, as it means your heart is still able to beat properly and pump blood throughout the body, it just does so irregularly.

But it's still pretty bad, as things like fighting cause your pulse to shoot way up, which increases the workload of your heart and makes it more likely and devastating every time your heart skips a beat. Every 15 IC, you take a \-2 to Accuracy, d20 rolls, and Defensive rolls. This penalty can be reduced by 1 by taking a Rest action, but if it does then you do not lower your Stamina penalty, as is normal.

But the more you fight, the worse it gets, and there is only so much even a ninja can do to support themselves while their heart isn't working properly. This penalty can only be reduced to half its highest amount reached (if it becomes a \-5 to Accuracy, d20 rolls and Defensive rolls, you can only reduce it by Resting to \-3).

This penalty does not increase outside of combat, but will continue to affect you every time you fight. One of the worst problems with this injury is how it is a chronic condition that the body can't fix by itself, once it's happened.

### **\- (41 \- 60 ) Slow Roasted (Abdomen)**

When something is cooked poorly, the outside tends to burn first, but the inside is typically not that bad. But when something is really charred, it is not just that the outside blackens and dies, but it ends up encapsulating the interior, preventing the escape of heat.

That's basically just what happened to you. So while your skin is flaking from your stomach and looks absolutely horrifying every time you breathe in and out, the real problem is how your innards have been superheated and are unable to effectively cool off. The end result is a constant feeling of sickness that seems impossible to treat.

You automatically advance one Fatigue level and gain Burn 10\. Penalties to your Stamina and Chakra Exhaustions rolls are not reset to 0 when you advanced a Fatigue level, and you advance an additional Fatigue category for every 10 points you fail a roll by, rather than every 15\.

You can still Rest, but it becomes a Speed 15 action, to which AP still cannot be applied. Out of combat you recover Fatigue levels at the rate of 1 per OOC day (rather than hour), and cannot recover below Fatigue 1\. Similarly, you regain one point of Willpower each OOC day, rather than all your Willpower each day.

### **\- (61 \- 80 ) Red Right Hand (Arms)**

The name is something of a misnomer, actually--your hand is black. You can't feel it, you can't use it. It's still there, although it's hard to tell how much of it is salvagable at a glance, because it's just that badly charred.

You lose the usage of a hand. You can not make seals, hold two-handed weapons and so forth. You take a \-8 to Accuracy rolls, and a \-4 to Defensive rolls---Parrying suffers the penalty to Defensive rolls, not Accuracy rolls, as is normal

### **\- (81 \- 100\) Melted Leg (Legs)**

Your clothing and leg were both burnt so horridly that it's hard to tell where one ends and the other begins. Much to your displeasure, you can still feel the limb--or, rather, the mass of agonizing pain where your functional leg used to be. When you move, bits of black flake off--probably best not to think about whether or not that's clothing or flesh.

This reduces AGI by 75% for everything (Dodge, AP, Movement, etc), and prevents you from using movement-enhancing jutsu such as Shunshin or Racing Thunder Technique (the Doton Mud Wave Technique and techniques that provide flight can still be used normally, as they don't rely on actual use of your legs).
