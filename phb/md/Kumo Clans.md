## **Fūryosu**

**All Fūryosu start with 1 less Unique Point.**

### **Sky Speaker**

The Fūryosu have long held the belief that the very heavens has a will of its own. That the skies above are a conscious entity whose actions seem random and without meaning only because mortal man lacks the ability to comprehend the greater truths of the world. However, despite counting themselves as mortal men also, the Fūryosu believe they possess a special connection to the skies. Claiming that they are favored by the skies, and can even understand the language of the heavens, using it to communicate with it and each other. While many outside the Clan disregard such claims as mere deceptions to hide the Clan's secrets and techniques, it cannot be denied that the Fūryosu do seem to have a special talent for surviving the harshest of weather conditions. Whether it be a blizzard or a thunderstorm, a Fūryosu can simply walk through it and come out the other end completely unharmed.

Cost: 20  
Scale: 0  
Limit: 1

Effects: You can perfectly predict any weather conditions and changes to the weather for the next week, so long as you get to stare at the sky for 1 hour (Which does not exclude you from doing other things during that hour).

Furthermore, your connection to the sky has granted you a special resistance to all weather conditions. You half any static Weather based penalties, and half the frequency of any increasing penalties (So if a Weather Condition normally gave a penalty every 10 ICs, for you it becomes every 20 ICs)

### **Araton \- Storm Release**

Combining lightning and water chakra results in the advanced nature of Araton, or “storm release”; a mystical and strange power even in a world full of strange powers, involving the manipulation of clouds and the weather itself to rain down thunder and hail on the enemy.

Any Raiton or Suiton Technique may be converted to Araton, with the following effects:

* \+5 Chakra cost  
* Araton only deals 75% Final Damage when targeting anything outside of a "Storm Cloud" area.   
* Suiton transformed Araton techniques which create Gallons of Water, do not. Instead, they generate or increase an existing "Storm Cloud" area by half of the Gallons of Water amount (Rounded Up).  
* The "Storm Cloud" Area is always centered on you, and follows you when you move.   
* The "Storm Cloud" Area has a max size of 5+CHA/5.  
* Raiton transformed Araton Damage-Dealing techniques may absorb some or all of a "Storm Cloud" to supercharge the lightning, increasing the Speed of the attack by 1 for the purpose of Damage Calculation for every 1 Area "Storm Cloud" is decreased by. Up to a maximum of half of the Base Speed of the Technique. This is done before any AP expenditures. The "Storm Cloud" decrease only happens after the Technique has fully resolved.  
* Araton is weak to Fuuton, but strong against Katon and Doton.

### **Storm Cloud**

This isn't a Status Effect, rather, the Fūryosu generate highly charged and volatile dark clouds which float overhead and are always centered on you. 

The Fūryosu shinobi is considered to be everywhere in the Area of the "Storm Cloud" at once for purposes of determining the range of Araton techniques and where the attack originates as they bring down thunder and lightning from above; though they are not physically occupying the entire space and may still be targeted normally. Techniques such as Rising Phoenix Blast, if used as an interrupt, cannot target a Fūryosu that performs an Araton technique in this manner as the attack does not originate from them. Though such techniques may still be used as a Ninjutsu Parry. You have an upkeep of 0 while you have a storm cloud. If an ally enters the storm’s radius you may increase the upkeep by 1 to exclude them from the attacks below.

Once every 15 ICs, everybody (Except for the Fūryosu) within a Storm Cloud Area are struck by a lightning bolt; this is a speed 10 to determine defenses and cannot be AP down. This can be defended against, counting as a Ninjutsu Ranged Attack with the Fūryosu's current ACC-2. Though any interrupts performed against this do not move the defender's IC. If a target is hit, they take (Storm Cloud Size)d6*1d4 Energy damage.


### **Arashi no Kisetsu \- Storm Season**

Type: C Rank \- Araton Ninjutsu  
Chakra: 21  
Upkeep: X\*4  
Area: Special  
Speed: 10  
Seal Speed: 16  
Special: Requires a "Storm Cloud" Area

Effects: X has a max of 3\. So long as you have a "Storm Cloud" area, you are able to use this Technique to drastically change the weather within that Area. Replace the current Weather Conditions within your "Storm Cloud" Area with X number of these conditions:

Fog, Heavy Rain, Snow, Hail, Extreme Cold, High Winds.

Furthermore, if you apply either (Heavy Rain \+ High Winds) or (Extreme Cold \+ High Winds) together, the Weather Condition becomes a Thunderstorm or a Blizzard instead, respectively. Replacing the two Weather Conditions with the one mentioned.

### **Arashiba: Goshiki No Kumo \- Stormstride: Five Colored Cloud**

(Flavor Text)

Type: C Rank \- Suiton Ninjutsu  
Chakra: 14  
Upkeep: 4  
Speed: 10  
Seal Speed: 13  
Gallons Requirement: 5

Effects: You generate a thick cloud of semi-condensed evaporated chakra. While the cloud is not dense enough to block attacks with, it can still bear a decent amount of weight. Allowing you, and up to two other individuals to stand on it. Which is a speed 8 Action if done in the middle of combat. Once you are riding the cloud, you gain immunity to any ground-based effects. And you may direct it to move, using your (CHA \+ 25%) for your Movement instead of your AGI, ignoring any Immobilization penalties you suffer from for movement only. Additionally, you can move upwards into the sky, up to a max of CHA/10. Anybody targeting you with a Ranged Attack adds this distance into the distance their attack has to cover to reach you. Any Melee Taijutsu Attacks that target you must perform the "Move with an Attack" maneuver to jump up and reach you, after the attack resolves, the Taijutsu user will fall back to the ground, and must perform the Maneuver again to hit you the next time. If they instead initiate a clinch or pin they instead remain on top of the cloud and the two of you are in a grapple as normal.

Furthermore, if the Cloud is 5 Yards or more in the air, it'll start drizzling rain. Adding 2 Gallons of Water into the battlefield every 5 ICs.

### **Arashi no Kamikari \- Storm God's Wrath**

(Flavor Text)

Type: B Rank \- Araton Ninjutsu  
Chakra: 42  
Damage: Special  
Area: Special  
Speed: 17, Special  
Seal Speed: 22  
Requires: "Storm Season" to be active and a "Storm Cloud" of a minimum of Area 20\.

Effect: Area of this technique is equal to the size of your "Storm Cloud". And for every 2 Area your "Storm Cloud" is at, the Speed of this technique increases by 1 for damage purposes only, which has no cap. This creates a formidable Hurricane that decimates everything in the Area, with the exception of a 3x3 yard region centered on you, considered to be the eye of the storm. At base, this Hurricane deals 6d12 \* 1d3 Energy damage, but depending on the Weather Conditions chosen for "Storm Season" the hurricane gains a variety of effects.

\-Fog: The Hurricane leaves behind a thick mist which covers an area equal to the Size of the Storm Cloud (Including the eye of the storm). Anybody inside this area (Regardless of whether they defended against the initial attack or not)  takes a \-8 Visibility penalty. The mist lasts for 100 ICs before it fades away.

\-Heavy Rain: The Hurricane adds (Storm Cloud Size \* 2\) Gallons of Water onto the battlefield.

\-Snow: The Hurricane leaves behind a heavy blanket of snow which covers an Area equal to the Size of the Storm Cloud (Including the eye of the storm). Anybody inside this area (Regardless of whether they defended against the initial attack or not) takes a \-4 Immobilization penalty and a \-5 to Stealth. The snow lasts for 100 ICs before it completely melts.

\-Hail: If the Hurricane applies a Wound, apply an additional Slashing Wound of the same Severity. And it also Applies Bleed 8\.

\-Heavy Cold: The Hurricane freezes (Storm Cloud Size \* 2\) Gallons of Water in the battlefield, turning them into Ice. This would include the Gallons of Water generated by this technique if "Heavy Rain" had also been applied. 

\-High Winds: The Hurricane picks up anybody within the area (With the exception of those in the eye of the storm) and hurls them around. Choose a cardinal direction for each target (N, W, S, E, NW, NE, SW, SE), they suffer a Knockback towards that direction equal to the Size of the Storm Cloud used in this Technique. This effect happens even if the targets had successfully defended against the other effects of this technique.

\-Thunderstorm: Increase the Hurricane's damage dice by 6d12 \* 1d3 (rolling a total of 12d12 \* 1d6), it now applies Paralysis 2 for 50 ICs. And if it applies a Wound, it applies an additional Energy Wound of one less Severity (Minimum of a Minor)

\-Blizzard: The Hurricane flash freezes the bodies of any struck targets, reducing their current and maximum AP by (Storm Cloud Size/2) for the duration of the fight. And if it applies a Wound, it applies an additional Piercing Wound of one less Severity (Minimum of a Minor)

## **Chinoike**

**All Chinoike start with 1 less Unique Point and Elemental Aptitude and Elemental Affinity for Suiton.**

### **Ketsuryūgan**

The Chinoike Clan possesses a unique Dōjutsu called the Ketsuryūgan (Translated to the "Blood Dragon Eyes). This crimson-hued ocular Kekkei Genkai grants its wielder powers that are equally disturbing and fantastical, all of them based around the control and manipulation of blood.  The Chinoike, nicknamed as the holders of the "eyes as red as blood" had, at one time, possessed one of the most powerful Dōjutsu's in the Shinobi World. Its power earning it comparison to the Three Great Dōjutsu. But unfortunately, many of its most horrific (and powerful) abilities have been diluted away in the modern age by too thin of a bloodline. Powers that are said to impart Genjutsus that could match or even surpass that of the Sharingan's, and at the zenith of their powers could transpose their enemies into a real hellscape of blood and darkness where none could survive.

The tragedy that led to them losing it all, both their powers and influence. Was caused by the Clan's near entire genocide when they betrayed the Land of Lightning in a distant, but still not-forgotten past. Though, steadily, as time passes and wounds heal, the Chinoike's bloodline grows stronger as does the quantity and quality of those born with the Ketsuryūgan. Perhaps, soon enough, one will be born who will be able to bring the Chinoike back to their former glory.

Upon activation, the current Ketsuryūgan makes the user's sclera glow bright red, irises black circles, and pupils into white shaped as horizontal rectangles. This Dōjutsu confers the strange ability to "see" the blood within people. This is further amplified when the blood leaves their bodies, allowing the user to see a noticeable red mist surrounding even a single droplet of blood. It is said that a Chinoike's ability to detect blood in the field rivals that of a shark in the water. Expanding upon this sensory power, the Chinoike have taken advantage of their unique awareness regarding the secrets of blood to develop many techniques based around the manipulation of that crimson essence of life. Which is only possible with the Ketsuryūgan active.

Upkeep: 2  
Speed: 1

Effects: You are able to automatically detect any information regarding the blood of anybody within line of sight. This information extends to everything from their blood type, blood pressure, immune system, etc.... All the way to detecting abnormalities in the blood such as diseases or poisons coursing through their bloodstream. This ability to flawlessly study an individual's physiological state gives you the power to "cold read" anybody you look at, gaining a \+5 to any rolls to detect their current emotional state, and/or whether they're lying or being truthful.

Your sensitivity to blood is amplified when said blood is actually outside of its rightful owner's body. You gain a bonus to Search, Scan, or Track a Target equal to that Target's (Combined Bleed stacks/2). If there are multiple Targets with different or non-existent Bleed Severities, then calculate your roll results individually according to each Target.

Whenever you inflict bleed on a target that already has bleed you may add both together using the oldest bleed for the purposes of determining when it will reduce. So long as you have the Ketsuryūgan active, you are also able to perform the Chinoike's clan Techniques.

### **Sanguine Transference**

Type: Ability  
Base Cost: 30  
Scale: 0  
Limit: 1  
Requires: 10 Chakra Control

Effects: For every 2 points of Vitality someone on the battlefield loses to Chiton based Bleed, you regain 1 Vitality (capped at normal Maximum Vitality). For every 50 Vitality gained this way (which means if you’re at max vit, you don’t work towards this recovery), you reduce your Stamina and Chakra Exhaustion penalties by 1\.

### **Shaketsu No Jutsu \- Bloodletting Technique**

Oftentimes blood lost on the battlefield simply stains the ground and is forgotten about. Through your Ketsuryūgan you can force the blood to pool and maintain its shape to replace gallons in your suiton techniques.

Type: E Rank \- Chiton Ninjutsu  
Cha: 5+X  
Speed: 2  
Tags: Interrupt

Effect: You can use this immediately after someone reduces their bleed. X has a max of the Bleed reduced and adds X gallons of blood to the battlefield

### **Blood is Thicker Than Water**

In the eyes of the Chinoike there is little difference between water and the fresh blood of their enemies on the battlefield. While they can only sense the blood still in someone's body after it escapes the chinoike gains the ability to freely manipulate it for use in suiton techniques. In fact this is such a simple feat that any chinoike can perform it upon unlocking their Ketsuryūgan.

Effect: You may use Blood on the battlefield in place of Gallons of Water to perform Suiton. Every gallon of blood is equivalent to 2 Gallons of Water. If at least half of the Gallons spent in a Suiton Jutsu are replaced by Blood, the water of the Jutsu takes on a scarlet color, becoming a Chiton Jutsu. Any jutsu that doesn’t require gallons can also be converted to Chiton by increasing its cost by 5\. Damaging jutsu also deal slashing damage

Chiton Techniques always deal slashing damage and inflict bleed equal to the rank of the jutsu\*2. If they would produce gallons instead they produce half as many gallons of blood. If "Water Cutting Blade" is turned into a Chiton Jutsu, then all Swords made by the technique only deal slashing Damage and have an additional \+25% Wounding Bonus. 

### **Blood Jar**

6 Gallons worth of specially processed animal (supposedly) blood tightly sealed within a clay gourd so that it doesn't spoil. This Blood may be used to supply  Suiton and Chiton Jutsus similarly to "Blood is Thicker Than Water" Ability, Due to the weight and size of the gourd, you can only carry one at a time.

Type: Gear  
Cost: 25000 Ryo

### **Shukketsu Shihai \- Hemo Dominance**

(Flavor Text)

Type: C Rank \- Chiton Ninjutsu  
Chakra: 10 \+ (BG \* 2\)  
Speed: 8  
Seal Speed: 14  
Range: 15  
Blood Gallons Requirements: 3 \> 15

Effects: X is the number of Blood Gallons used to pay for this technique. This cannot be Defended against. You target someone in the battlefield in range. They must pass a Status Check with a penalty equal to half the combined Bleed stacks they suffer from, or receive a single Blood Curse of your choosing from the list below:

\- **Curse of Bloated Agony**: You curse the target's blood to expand within the arteries running right beneath the bleeding wounds, causing their body to painfully bloat and their skin to bruise until they are a misshapen, purplish monstrosity ready to pop at the slightest pressure. Every time a target with this curse is struck by a Damage-Dealing Attack, treat the Damage they receive as if it is 10+(BG)% higher for the purpose of Wounding.

**\- Curse of the Bloodshot Eyes**: You curse the target so that the tiny blood vessels within their eyes burst, causing an internal bleeding that blocks the target's sight and gives their eyes an ugly and disturbing dark red hue (kind of like the Chinoike's themselves\!). The target will suffer a Visibility penalty equal to \-(BG/3)

**\- Curse of Corrosive Blood**: You curse the target's blood so that it burns their insides like acid as it circulates through their body, the veins across the target's skin body become far more noticeable as they take on an unsettling black color. The target will suffer from Poison of a Severity equal to (BG/3).

They also gain a bleed equal to BG/2 rounded up. The curse lasts until the bleed is reduced to 0\. You can only be affected by one curse at a time.

### **Blood Frenzy**

(Flavor Text)

Type: C Rank \- Chiton Ninjutsu  
Cha: 22  
Upkeep: X/5  
Speed: 6  
Requires: A Target with a minimum Combined Bleed of 5\.

Effect: Your Ketsuryugan eyes temporarily regain some of their unsettling splendor, and powers. You go onto a Frenzy and lock onto a Bleeding Target, turning them into your Prey. Combine all Bleed stacks that your Prey currently has, the result is X. This Technique's X must be a minimum of 5\. The sight and scent of so much blood ignites your bloodline’s instincts, and you heighten the chakra accumulation in your own blood to boost your abilities drastically. However, so long as you maintain the Upkeep of this Technique, you can never attack anybody else except for the Prey of this Technique, and any Attacks with an Area must be centered on them. Worse, you can not use any Jutsu or Action that does not target your Prey (Such as self buffing Techniques, Rest, Meditation, etc.) with some form of Attack or Effect. Search (And similar Actions) may still be performed, but you can only discover your Prey and nobody else, everybody else may as well not exist for you.

Your Frenzy grants you the following benefits:

\- You can perform "Hemo-Dominance" and non-Area Genjutsu on your Prey regardless of if they're Hidden or not, and no matter the distance.  You also gain a bonus to all Genjutsu Offense Rolls equal to (X/5).

\- You may reduce the Speed of all Damage-Dealing Attacks directed at your Prey by up to (X/4), similar to spending AP. In addition to this, your Final Speed counts as (X/3) higher for Damage Purposes only.

\- You gain (X \* 2)% increase in Movement when Moving towards your Prey, or when Moving as part of an Attack.

\- You double your Ketsuryugan's bonuses for the Search Action (And similar Actions), so it becomes a total Bonus of \+(Combined Bleed Stacks).

You may \-whilst maintaining this Technique's Upkeep- swap who your prey is at any time, as a Speed 6 Action with no chakra cost. As long as the new Prey also has a combined Chiton based Bleed of 5 or higher. You use your new Prey's Combined Bleed to determine the bonuses you receive.

### **Kūkan-Teki: Jigoku No Tani \- Spatial Dissonance: Valley of Hell**

This Technique will create an area around the user that resembles the adopted home of the Chinoike Clan, known only as the “Valley of Hell”. This area flows with rivers of red water consisting of high iron content similar to that of blood, which lends itself nicely to the clan’s techniques.

Type: B Rank \- Chiton Ninjutsu  
Chakra: 30  
Upkeep: 6  
Area: 50 Centered on Self.  
Speed: 20  
Requires: Blood Frenzy active.

Effects:

You transpose a small section of a realm of blood and darkness on top of this reality, a realm that is known as the Valley of Hell. The rivers of blood here are endless, if somewhat viscous making them slow to replenish. You always have 10 Gallons of Blood available for Suiton and Chiton Jutsus.

Additionally, Anybody suffering from Bleed that is within this area treats their Bleed as if it was double its severity, and it is reduced every 10 ICs rather than 20 ICs. Each target's Combined Bleed is also treated as double its value for "Blood Frenzy" and this Technique.

Finally, so long as a target is within the Valley of Hell your Chiton Techniques, the blood spewing out of their bodies like geysers starts to physically weigh them down as it becomes chains of blood tying them to this domain of darkness. They suffer a Paralysis equal to (Target's Combined Bleed/10).

## **Saishihō**

**All Saishihō start with Raiton Affinity, and gain the Aptitude for Raiton for free.**

### **Wire Weaving**

Originally a family of seamsters and embroiderers whose name has been lost to time, the Saishihō had spent generations mastering the graceful art of weaving fabric into beautiful tapestries and clothes of intricate design and unparalleled quality. Developing secret family techniques that brought them fame and wealth all across the land. However, when the family had its home burnt down and its riches plundered by foreign Shinobi forces, they were forced to adopt their family secrets for sewing and thread manipulation into weapons to protect their land against those who wished them harm. Replacing the multi-colored threads of cotton and silk for metal wires, they had discovered that their techniques and proficiency for weaving fabric could be perfectly adopted into a subtle and lethal fighting style designed for countering and assassinating Shinobis. With that discovery, they had also realized that everybody born in the family had a natural aptitude and talent for the ninja skills that’s matched only by few others. The biggest proof of which is their natural gift for Lightning Release, as befitting their origin, which only served to enhance their already dangerous fighting style. Allowing them to develop entirely unique techniques mixing steel and lightning. And thus, the now widely feared Saishihō Clan as it is known today was born. A Clan that wove a beautiful dance of death with their hands alone, each fluid movement of their digits trapping their foe in an ever tightening web of Raiton enhanced steel. Ensnaring them in traps meant to nullify every normal trick of the Shinobi, or hacking them into a million little pieces with razor-sharp wires. 

Effects: You have mastered the art of weaponizing Ninja Wire for all manner of traps and weaponry. Wires count as a conductive material. And so long as you have at least 5 Yards of Ninja Wire on hand, you may use the following Action which counts as an E Rank Raiton Ninjutsu Technique:

### **Tripwire**

Stamina: 15  
Damage: Special  
Speed: 8   
Range: 5+(STR/10)  
Requires: 5 Yards of Ninja Wire

Effect: You may add your Raiton Affinity Bonus to the Chakra Check of this action. You channel Lightning Chakra through Ninja Wire to make it extremely sharp and able to stick to any surface, allowing you to make deadly Trip Wire traps. Choose two spots that are exactly 5 Yards from each other and within the Range of this Action. You throw two ends of a 5 Yards long Ninja Wire, remotely sticking one end towards each spot, creating a Tripwire Line between the two spots. 

Anybody that crosses that Line through any sort of movement that does not ignore Ground-Based Effects is shredded by the rapidly circulating Raiton energy enhancing the wire's sharpness. They take (CHA/8)D4 \* 1D4 \+ (NDB \* 8\) Slashing Damage which ignores the Target's DR and Armor, and then fall Prone (As per the E Rank "Trip" Jutsu), and end their movement on the spot of the Trip Wire they crossed (Even if they had used a Technique that was meant to make them travel further). The Trip Wire also releases a very bright and audible flash which will notify anybody in the vicinity that it had been tripped, and break the Target's stealth. If the Damage is enough to deal a Wound then the Wound is applied to the Legs.

### **Unmei No Ito \- Threads of Destiny**

While the Saishiho are more than able to perform and amaze their opponents with their deadly wire tricks in the open, the crux of their strategy relies on deception. Thus ninjas of the clan are taught the ways of sleight of hand to bind these wires to their foes, masquerading as regular physical attacks. The wires are mundane and thus fragile and easy to snap if found, but those that are unaware are bound to the Saishiho ninja. The wires easily telegraphs the motions and position of attached ninja and acts as a conductor for the rest of the Saishiho's arsenal

Type: D Rank \- General Ninjutsu  
Stamina: 5 \+ As Unarmed or Weapon Attack  
Damage: As Unarmed or Weapon Attack  
Range: Melee, Special  
Speed: \+6  
Requires: X Yards of Ninja Wire  
Tags: Utility, Link

Effect: This requires a called shot to a body part, and you add the Speed of this Technique to whatever Attack you perform. You strike the target with a basic Unarmed or Weapon Taijutsu Attack (Which includes ranged weapons, as a reminder), and manage to stick a nearly invisible thread of Ninja Wire somewhere on the Target's body part. This requires an Espionage Check vs the Target's Awareness, if they succeed against you then they discover the wire and immediately sever it from themselves. Otherwise, it remains on their body undiscovered for (Y \* 3\) ICs, connecting them to you. Where Y is how much you beat their Awareness roll by. Once that duration passes, they automatically discover the Ninja Wire and cut the connection.

So long as you have enough Ninja Wire on you to cover the distance between you and that Target and they have not discovered it, you have a Thread of Destiny connection with them. You always count as being aware of where they are, and any attempt at Stealth by them automatically fails against you. And you gain a \+1 Accuracy and \+2 to Defensive rolls against them as the vibrations transmitted through the wire inform you of their every move before they do it. Additionally, you may perform the C Rank Raiton Technique "Wave of Inspiration" through the Thread of Destiny, which counts as a conductive material for the bonuses of that Technique. This destroys ALL Threads of Destiny connections between you and the Target.

If the target moves a distance beyond how many Yards of Ninja Wire you have on you, then the Thread of Destiny is severed. And the Yards of Ninja Wire used on this Technique are unusable for anything else until it ends.

### **Orishishū No Jutsu \- Embroidered Mesh Technique**

With careful trickery and enough wires placed, a Saishiho ninja can unleash their ultimate trap with the wave of an electrically charged hand. The wire that was meticulously placed onto an unaware opponent suddenly springs into life and curls back into itself with electric fervor. While not able to kill the trapped ninja as is, the combination of electric current and binding wire allows for the perfect setup for a killing blow. Gloating to them about outsmarting them or predicting their next line is optional. 

Type: C Rank \- Raiton Ninjutsu  
Stamina: 25  
Speed: 16  
Requires: 3 Threads of Destiny on the same Target.  
Tags: Grapple

Effect: If you have 3 Threads of Destiny connected to the same Target, then you can channel electricity through them to wrap around the Target, binding him or her. This is automatic and cannot be avoided. And you lose all of the normal benefits of Thread of Destiny. The Target becomes Grappled and is treated as if they are in a Clinch, except it is with the Ninja Wires instead of you. And they also take 2 Arm Locks, and 2 Leg Locks and all the penalties which ensue with that until they break the Wire binding them. Typically, steel wire is easy to break out of for Chakra enhanced ninja. However, the addition of Raiton increases the wire's durability and disorganizes the Target's musculature enough that they can't as easily summon their strength to escape. The Wire is treated as having a base 10+CHA/8 Grapple Off and 10+CHA/8 for Grapple Def to any relevant Break Clinch or Escape Grapple attempts. Anybody attempting to escape gains a cumulative \+5 to any Escape Grapple or Break Clinch actions after the first one. The Wire does not get any bonuses from a target's failed Break Clinch actions. 

### **Lacerator (Small, Chain, Dual, Blunt One-Handed)**

The Lacerator utilized by Saishihō is a modified version of a tool used by monks for self mutilation and atonement. A Small pair of instruments consisting of ninja wire yo-yo’s. Its attacks far reaching and nearly invisible, this weapon is a deadly tool in the hands of the death weavers of Clan Saishihō. Yet even they often struggle with its use, and it takes an incredibly deft hand to bring out the full potential of this graceful instrument of death.

Cost: 65000  
Stamina: 10  
Damage: (Espionage/2)D8  
Range: 10  
Speed: 12  
Special: \+1 Accuracy  
Delay: 4

Effect: Grappling someone with this weapon (Such as through Entangling Lash) does not impose a penalty on your own Dodge or Parry interrupts, though the weapon can not be used for anything else while a grapple is maintained, and Ignite statuses do not transfer between grapplers. In addition, the person you’re grappling with can not move more than 10 yards away from you: if they would do something that would move them further, you are moved as well (and vice-versa), though normal rules for trying to move while in a grapple apply. You can always elect to end the grapple by simply declaring so and manipulating the Lacerator to release your Target. Once someone is Grappled with this weapon, you can perform any Grapple jutsu of C Rank or lower on them, with the exception of Suplex and Headbutt. Additionally, you may perform "No Design, No Conception" outside of a Grapple, except you can use it from Range 10 instead of just Range 0\.  The Weapon is considered to have unlimited limbs.

You may direct Raiton Techniques of C Rank or lower through the Lacerator towards anybody being Grappled by it. These Techniques automatically hit and the Lacerator counts as a conductive surface. Directing a C-Rank Raiton Technique through the Lacerator, however, ends up destroying it. Additionally, Attacks from Stealth using this Weapon do not automatically break your Stealth, but instead lower your Stealth TN by 5\.

## **Kanato**

**All Kanato start with 1 less UP**

### **Shinton \- Vibration Release**

Combining lightning and wind chakra results in the advanced nature of Shinton, or “Vibration Release”; a mystical and strange power even in a world full of strange powers, involving the manipulation of clouds and the weather itself to rain down thunder and hail on the enemy.
Any Raiton or Fuuton Technique may be converted to Shinton, with the following effects:

* +5 Chakra Cost
* Shinton cannot be Blocked, ignores half DR, and ignores Armor. It also deals Blunt damage unless the technique specifies.
* Shinton Techniques can be either High Frequency or Low Frequency, decided by the user at the time that the Jutsu is declared.
* Shinton Techniques cannot apply Paralysis. Instead, they apply a Stun equal to twice the Paralysis' Severity.
* Shinton Damage Dealing Techniques do not gain any bonuses to Wounding from any source. Instead, every 15% extra wounding that would have been applied adds or increases the Technique's Stun by 1.
* High Frequency Shinton only deals 75% of Final Damage.
* High Frequency Shinton has +CHA/30 Accuracy bonus.
* Low Frequency Shinton Damage Dealing Techniques force the target to roll Athletics or Resistance VS your Chakra Control. Failure means they fall prone.
* Low Frequency Shinton Techniques increase their Area by CHA/30
* Shinton is weak to Katon, but strong against Raiton and Doton.


### **Resonance**

By combining the sound waves of multiple jutsu you can combine their intensities to enhance the power of your Shinton jutsu. When you use a Shiton jutsu, the sound waves linger in its affected area (or a circle with a radius of its range if it doesn’t have an area) for IC equal to twice the speed of the jutsu. If another Shinton jutsu with a chakra cost less then or equal to the original and has the same frequency is used within that time it gains the benefits below provided it passes through the area:

- High Frequency Shinton Damage Dealing Techniques apply the Ringing Noise Minor wound except it stacks separately than other versions for the purposes of determining its duration. This does not apply if the attack's damage was reduced by partial defense.
  
- Low Frequency Shinton Damage Dealing Techniques increase their damage by half the damage dice of the original jutsu (not accounting for any increases such as through Elemental Mastery).


### **Kyōmei-Ha No Jutsu \- Resonance Blade Technique**

"Hear the blade of song" 

Type: C Rank - Shinton Ninjutsu
Chakra: 22
Upkeep: 5
Speed: 9
Requires: A held weapon.
Effects: You channel high intensity vibrations through your weapon, causing it to become a highly lethal tool that can crush, cut, or pierce through anything. Attacks with this weapon gain the properties of either high or low frequency (chosen on declaration). Attacks with this weapon cannot create or take advantage of interference.


### **Chinmoku Junshu No Jutsu \- Silent Adherence Technique**

Type: D Rank \- Shinton Ninjutsu
  
Chakra: 12  
Range: Special  
Area: Special  
Speed: 8  
Seal Speed: 10  
Requires: A single Kunai or Small Weapon.

Effects:

You stab the Kunai or Small Weapon into a nearby surface such as the ground or wall, and infuse it with a vibrational frequency too high to be picked up by human ears. These vibrations will cancel out any others in a 10 Yard Radius centered on the Kunai. Creating a Dead Zone where no sound can be generated, nor leave or enter it. Everybody within this Dead Zone loses the benefits of Enhanced Hearing, as well as any Abilities based on. They cannot make any sounds, and any form of verbal or sound based communication is impossible. Attempting to direct a Summon's Actions while either the Summon or Summoner (Or both) is with this Dead Zone is impossible.

After (Chakra Control Ranks \* 2\) ICs, the Chakra within the weapon dissipates and this Technique ends. When you first perform this Technique, roll Espionage, this becomes the TN to discover the infused weapon. Anybody may perform a Search Action against your Espionage TN to find the weapon. If they uncover it then they can destroy it as a Speed 5 Action.

### **Onryō Ikkan-Sei No Jutsu \- Volume Coherence Technique**

Type: C Rank - Shinton Ninjutsu
Chakra: 26
Upkeep: 8
Area: 20 by 20 Square
Speed: 16
Seal Speed: 21
Requires: 8 Kunai.
Effects:
You throw out 8 Kunai infused with low or high (chosen on use) frequency vibrations, sectioning off a 20 by 20 Yard square. This area always provides the benefits of interference. This jutsu lasts for 15 IC increasing by 10 every time a Shinton jutsu is used within it or passes through it.

## **Yurigami**

**All Yurigami start with 1 less UP and automatically start out with an Affinity for Fuuton, and gain the Fuuton Aptitude for free.**

### **Paper Control**

The most basic and important ability of the Yurigami. Allowing them to control paper in many forms and for countless applications. (Extra Flavor Text)

Cost: 10  
Scale: 5  
Limit: (CHA+RES)/60, Limit 4\.

Effects: You can spend up to CHA/8 Sheets of Paper on any single Action or Yurigami Technique per rank bought in this ability. You also start the day with RES/2 sheets of Shikigami Paper which come from your body. Shikigami paper counts as 2 sheets of paper for everything except determining the maximum sheets spent at one time. Paper, both normal and Shikigami variety, is considered perishable: that is, once used in a Technique, it is simply gone.

### **Chakra Infused Paper**

Specially processed chakra infused paper made within the Yurigami clan. This is useful for when the Yurigami has run out of Shikigami Paper, or does not want to use it.

Type: Gear  
Cost: 100 Ryo per sheet of Paper

Effects: This can be used in Yurigami Techniques. Due to the encumbrance of carrying so much paper, you can only have a max of 100+(XP/10) Paper on you at any given moment. And because of their special nature, you can never store them within a Sealing Scroll.

### **Rice Paper Creation**

As they progress in their abilities, the Yurigami develop the ability to turn their body into paper. What makes this so unusual is that it's not a transformation technique, such as Henge; physically, they become paper, yet still function fully.  Though it'll require far more practice to utilize this unique nature of theirs in more offensive ways, they're still able to shed portions of their paper-like body without appreciable harm, arming themselves with paper even when none is available.

Base Cost: 2  
Scale: 2  
Limit: 1+CHA/20

Effects:  Each Rank allows 20 Vitality (Or HP if Vitality is at 0\) to be converted to 5 sheets of Shikigami Paper as a Speed 6 Action, to a maximum of 20 Vitality per Action, per Rank. You cannot have more Shikigami Papers through this Ability than the amount you normally start the day with through "Paper Control". Any excess Shikigami Paper is considered to be lost.

### **Origami Dōka No Jutsu \- Origami Paper Assimilation Technique**

As they are able to split portions of their body off into paper, the Yurigami can similarly reintegrate that same paper to themselves to patch up any serious injuries they've attained. Still, there is a difference between mere paper, and paper which is 'them'; regrettably, being in a library does not make them near-immortal.

Type: C Rank \- General Ninjutsu  
Chakra: 10+X  
Speed: 14  
Seal Speed: 10  
Requires: Sheets of Paper.

Effects: X is the amount of Shikigami Paper spent on this Technique. You may negate a wound that you are suffering from by absorbing 10 Shikigami Papers into your body per Severity of the Wound (10 for Minors, 20 for Majors, 30 for Severes, 40 for Criticals). This does not actually heal the wound, it is still there and will heal normally, you simply do not suffer its effects for the duration that it remains.

### **Oritaishi No Jutsu \- Folded Parchments Technique**

The Yurigami strengthens several pieces of paper, using them as a physical barrier against attacks. This can be done any number of ways, from a levitating cloud of folded papers, to parrying a blade with a stack held in one hand, to hardening and then flaking off the paper making up the Yurigami's body.

Type: D Rank \- General Ninjutsu  
Chakra: 13  
Speed: 8  
Seal Speed: 7  
Special: Interrupt, Link  
Requires: Sheets of Paper.

Effects: This Technique counts as a Block, but this special Block has a base 0% for reducing damage. Every sheet of Paper spent on this Technique increases Blocking's effectiveness by 3%. Shikigami Paper spent this way increases Blocking's effectiveness by 5% instead. You are still limited by the cap of paper spent from Paper Control.

This Technique may also be used after a failed defense, combining their Speeds together. So long as it is still a valid Interrupt. Used this way, it can only be performed with Shikigami Paper.

### **Shihyaku No Kirikami \- Death of A Hundred Papercuts**

The Yurigami folds their paper into any number of shapes, typically chakrams, that are razor sharp and extremely deadly.

Type: D Rank \- General Ninjutsu  
Chakra: 5+X/2  
Damage: Xd6  
Range: 5+CHA/4  
Speed: 3+X/2  
Special: \+1 Accuracy, Bleed X/2.  
Requires: Sheets of Paper.

Effects: X is the number of Paper Projectiles thrown. This Technique functions as a multi-throw, following its normal rules (Minimum 5 speed, extra DB per thrown weapon, Wounding reduced by 1 Step to a minimum of Minors, etc...), but for every 3 Papers that you spend, you may throw 1 Paper Projectile, minimum of 2 Projectiles.  Additionally, if you throw 10 or more Paper Projectiles, then the multi-throw gains an Area equal to (Paper Projectiles/2). You use your NDB in place of PDB.

This can be modified, or used in conjunction, with anything that applies to Non-Senbon Thrown Weapons (Uniques, Abilities, Jutsus, etc...), but anything that increases the number of weapons you throw does not apply that effect.

### **Kami Bunshin No Jutsu \- Paper Clone Technique**

Using the Yurigami's control of paper, they modify the shape and color of their paper in order to create physical duplicates of themselves.

Type: C Rank \- General Ninjutsu  
Cost: 14 \+ 3 per Clone  
Speed: 10 \+ 2 per Clone  
Seal Speed: 6 \+ 1 per Clone  
Requires: Sheets of Paper

Effects: You create one or more Paper Clones which follow the normal rules for Clones, to a maximum of 3\. Each clone requires a minimum of 10 Sheets of Paper to be created, though you may choose to spend more than 10 on each individual clone. Unlike normal clones, these Paper Clones do not immediately disappear upon being hit, and instead have an HP pool equal to 5 times the amount of Paper spent on that individual clone. If their HP pool reaches 0, they are destroyed. By default, you are considered hidden among your clones when you create them. You may direct them to take actions by spending AP.

These clones may use basic attacks, dodge, parry, move, and the "Shihyaku No Kirikami" and "Oritaishi No Jutsu" Techniques. Costing 1 AP per 3 speed of the Action or Interrupt they perform. However, they do not spend any Paper for their Yurigami Techniques, instead always counting as having used an amount of Paper equal to the amount spent on the creation of that specific Clone.

### **Chiharetsu No Jutsu \- Bursting Knowledge Technique**

Type: C Rank \- General Ninjutsu  
Chakra: 5 \* X  
Speed: 2 \* X  
Special: Link  
Requires: Shikigami Paper, Chakra Control 15\.

Effects: X is the number of Explosive Tags created. You create a Tier 1 Explosive Tag for every 5 Shikigami Paper spent on this Technique. And may use them normally as per the Explosive Tags rules. If you possess a Chakra Control Rank of 20 or higher, then you may spend 10 Shikigami Papers to instead create Tier 2 Explosive Tags, these count as 2 Explosive Tags for the purpose of X calculations. All Explosive Tags created by this Jutsu last for (Chakra Control Ranks) amount of Hours, after that, the paper becomes a dud and turns into ash.

Additionally, you may also use this as a Link to your "Shihyaku No Kirikami" multi-throw attack, mixing in explosively charged papers amongst the thrown projectiles. Paying the Chakra Cost of each separately and combining their Speed for the purpose of Defense Validation and how much your IC is moved. The Explosive Tags are automatically applied to any target you hit, and will explode within 15 ICs. When this happens, the target and anybody else in the battlefield is allowed an Awareness Check vs your Espionage to notice the Tag, if they do, they may destroy all tags applied to themselves or somebody within Melee range as a Speed 2 \* X Action, nullifying the explosion. If your attack misses, the Explosive Tags still get placed on the ground. And others must still roll to notice them. If "Shihyaku No Kirikami" has an Area, then you must choose how to divide the Explosive Tags between the targets struck, you may also choose to instead place the Explosive Tags in any spot within the multi-throw's Area, and can mix and match between these options.

### **Shikigami No Odori \- Dance of the Shikigami**

The pinnacle of development of the Yurigami's abilities, with this ability not only can they turn themselves completely into paper, they no longer need to maintain their body's physical cohesion; they are every bit as self-aware as a cloud of flying sheets of paper as in a true 'human' form. Whether or not a Yurigami capable of performing this technique can even be considered fully human any more is up for debate.

Type: B Rank \- General Ninjutsu  
Chakra: 31  
Upkeep: 8  
Speed: 17  
Seal Speed: 22  
Requires: 1 Willpower.

Effects: You turn your body into a mass of rapidly expanding paper after spending 1 Willpower. In this form you start generating 5 Shikigami Papers every 10 ICs at no extra cost to you. Though you are still limited by the normal maximum of Shikigami Papers held.

You take 25% less Damage from Blunt and Piercing Damage Types. Are immune to Bleeds, Burns, and Poisons and end any such statuses immediately. Doujutsus or any other forms of sensory powers (Even Natural Chakra's) cannot automatically distinguish you from your Paper Clones, and may not use any benefits they give to discover you (Such as the Scan Action).  You cannot be directly targeted by Genjutsu (though Area Genjutsu will affect you normally). And any non-Area Ranged Attacks receive a \-4 Accuracy against you.

However, You cannot perform any non-Yurigami Jutsu while maintaining this Technique. Take \+25% Damage from Energy Damage Type. Any Ignite you gain counts as double its Severity. And you have a \-4 to Dodge any Techniques with an Area.

You can use this form to travel through tight spaces. And even possess the ability of flight. When flying, your movement speed is halved, though you ignore any ground based effects. And you may fly upwards, up to a maximum height in Yards equal to (Chakra Control Ranks/2). You may not be hit by Melee Attacks unless they can perform a "Move with an Attack" maneuver equal to your elevation (By jumping\!).

## **TARO**

**All TARO start with 1 less UP**

### **Transhumanist**

An incurable illness that no doctor could fix, a crippled body lacking a necessary limb, being born weak and with no natural talent to advance past their status. There are countless reasons why the Technological Advancement Research Objects (Or TAROs, for short) decided to proceed with the life-threatening surgery required to gain these technological alterations. But at its core, these are all symptoms of a far sadder cause: They had no other choice. They were to either adapt, or perish in this increasingly hostile Shinobi World. And adapt, they did. For the Technological Advancement Research Organization (Or TARO, for short. Yes, it's confusing on purpose. They're weird like that) has given these people more than a second chance at life. Superhuman capabilities, armaments matching and elevating powers mastered by the strongest of ninja, are the least of the benefits provided by these Cybernetic Augmentations. This all begins with their initial surgery replacing a core piece of their body with a mechanical one. The first one is the most crucial coming with the most risk but also the most effects. This can be a prosthetic limb, a fully metal spine, or even replacing part of their face. Due to this permanent alteration to your body it becomes easier for your body to handle more cybernetic enhancements so over time Taro increase their strength by replacing more of their body seeming only limited by the TARO’s capacity.

Type: Ability  
Cost: 0  
Scale: 10  
Limit: 1+((CHA+RES)/60)

Effects: At the first rank of this ability, you gain access to one major augmentation of your choice from the list. For every rank after the first you gain a minor augmentation from the list below.

### **Cybernetic Augmentations**

Cybernetic Augmentations, or Augs for short, are the proof of the Organization's extraordinarily advanced technology. Kumo, being far ahead of the rest of the world, managed to create artificial limbs and body parts surpassing the limits of a typical human body.  

Cybernetic Augmentation is a broad term that covers anything from artificially created prosthetics, to telescopic eyes, to defensive plating covering your entire body. The possibilities are vast but risky. Each person can only handle a limited number of augmentations and the process for doing so could lead to death, complete loss of your chakra pathway system, or worse.

#### **Head**

Name: HUD  
Type: Major  
Effects: You have welded a visor to your face or replaced the lenses of your eyes with miniature screens that provide a digital HUD (Heads Up Display) which only you can see, and which provides you with a multitude of information normally not accessible to you by studying processing every frame of visual information your eyes detect. You are able to precisely measure the dimensions of anything you look at and your Keen Senses Ability is considered to be 1 Rank above what it actually is, even above its normal cap. This also serves as a shield against anything that affects your perception or attempts to blind you. Any visibility penalties based on sight are reduced by half.

Name: Jaw Breaker  
Type: Major  
Effects: You have replaced your jaw and teeth with a hydraulically powered reinforced metal alloy maw (Many design theirs so it resembles the maw of an animal like a tiger or shark) that clamps down on your target with razor sharp metal teeth or fangs. Whenever you are in a grapple or the target has a minimum Immobilization of 6, you may perform the "Jaw Breaker" Action listed below:

Stamina: 15  
Damage: (STR/10)D12  
Speed: 10  
Tags: Piercing

Effects: This Attack must be a Called Shot to the Head, receiving any normal Called Shot penalties you'd receive. Once this Attack hits, you clamp down on the Target's throat and automatically enter a Grapple as the Attacker with the Target if you weren't already in one. While using the Jaw Breaker action you are unable to perform no other Actions except for interrupts. Every 10 ICs the Target remains affected by your Jaw Breaker action, they gain Suffocation 1 and take the damage from this attack treating the speed as 5 for damage calculations. This does not deal wounds initially but when you end your Jaw Breaker action the opponent gains a wound using the total damage dealt by this technique divided by 2\.

Additionally you are always treated as possessing and using a Gas Mask. And can survive up an hour underwater or underground without any air. Whenever you are forced to make Suffocation checks, it's Stamina 10 for you instead of Stamina 15\.

Name: Memory Bank  
Type: Minor  
Effects: You have installed a storage unit directly over the part of your brain responsible for short term and long term memory storage. You have a Photographic Memory, and can perfectly recollect anything you've experienced with your five senses. Sights, Smells, Sounds. Anything. You can also remember these events with perfect clarity and can transfer them to physical copies. This process requires a modified camera and film but can create perfect recreations of what you saw.. Additionally, being perfectly aware of every moment of your life makes it nearly impossible for Genjutsu to fool you. You are instantly aware that you're under a Genjutsu when you fail your Gen Defense roll no matter the result. Though you still suffer all of its normal effects until you break the delusion.

Name: Echo-locator  
Type: Minor  
Effects: You have a built in miniature sonar dish that is able send out high frequency vibrations and receive them back to create a mental image of the space around directly in your mind. As a Speed 0 Chakra 10 action you can make a search action against anyone within CHA/4 yards. This search receives no benefits from consecutive search actions and is not treated as a search action for the stacking bonus.

Name: Voice Modulator  
Type: Minor  
Effects: You have replaced your voice box with an artificial voice generator.  So long as it is active, you can change the pitch and inflection or your voice to the point that it becomes impossible to distinguish that it is you, you can even make yourself sound robotic if you wish. You may also change your voice to perfectly match any other voice that you have heard. This is enough to fool anybody with a passing familiarity with the original owner's voice. When attempting to fool someone very familiar with the target you make an Espionage roll with a \+5 bonus against their Awareness, and if you succeed then they cannot tell you apart. Keep in mind that this is solely audio based, if they can see your face or body while you're trying to do this then obviously you aren't fooling anybody. Additionally, you can also speak without moving your mouth, and are able to project your voice somewhere nearby exactly like the Cicada Shell Technique but without paying any costs.

#### **Torso**

Name: Protective Plating  
Type: Major  
Effects: You have replaced a large chunk of your body (The surface, at least) with plates of hardened metal alloys designed to provide a decent amount of protection. As a Speed 6 action you can adjust the plates to either protect you from attacks or cut anyone who comes into contact with it. For the first form you gain DR equal to your RES/8. For the second form anyone who attacks you in melee range takes RES/8 damage if they hit.

Name: Cybernetic Musculature  
Type: Minor  
Effects: You have enhanced your muscles, spine, and ligaments with synthetic reinforcements so that you can overcharge your body for a short period of time. Once per fight as a Speed 0 action you can increase your strength by 30% then for the next 60 IC your strength reduces by 1% every IC. For every 10% your strength is increased/decreased you increase/reduce all penalties from Fatigue by 1\.

Name: Kinetic Dampening Field  
Type: Minor  
Effects: You have connected a device that projects a shield of pure chakra to protect yourself from incoming attacks. As a Speed 5 interrupt you can conjure your shield reducing the damage of the attack by your Vitality/10. Any damage you take goes to your Shield HP first and does not gain any benefits from DR. In a fight you can only reduce up to your vitality in damage using this ability.

Name: Life Support Unit  
Type: Minor  
Effects: You have installed a collection of bandages, ointments, and antiseptics mimicking a first aid kit to allow you to access these supplies at any time, even in a fight. You are always treated as having a first aid kit on you and all base speeds relating to using it are halved for you. This kit can be used a number of times equal to your ranks in Transhumanist per day.

Name: Webber  
Type: Minor  
Effects: You have installed in/on to your chest a gas powered launcher that is able to store and shoot out trapping nets. As a Speed 8 Action, you are able to shoot out a targeted projectile against someone within 10 Yards with a \+2 to your accuracy. Anybody hit by the net gains Immobilization 4\. Breaking out of the net is a Speed 5 Action that requires an opposed grapple roll where the Taro uses their base Grapple Off ignoring any modifiers, every consecutive roll to break the net gains a \+2 Bonus. The net can be targeted by attacks and is damaged by AOEs, having 20% of your vitality as durability. When its durability is reduced to 0 the effects of the net end.

#### **Arms**

Name: C.A.N.N.O.N.  
Type: Major  
Effects: The trademark armament of most TAROs, and one of the few things they still hold affection for in their cold, metallic hearts. The "Coiled Assault Neural-Network Operated Needler" or simply, the C.A.N.N.O.N., may very well be the tool that puts the Organization's units on par with the Shinobi that they so often combat. A retractable and extendable two feet and a half long rifle and barrel combo inlaid with highly wound copper coils implanted into your arm. The C.A.N.N.O.N. can hold up to 50 bullets of any type(s) of Rounds available in the TARO Armory, allowing you to mix and match as you wish. However, switching between what type of Round you are currently using is a Speed 4 Action.

Sniper Shot  
Chakra: 15  
Damage: (CHA/8)D10  
Range: CHA  
Speed: 15  
Special: \-5 Accuracy  
Delay: 4

Effects: This action uses your ninjutsu damage bonus and ninjutsu accuracy. You can perform a Speed 8 Aim Action to aim similarly to when using Bows to gain a \+3 Accuracy Bonus and your ndb is increased by 10% for your next attack using this weapon. You may Aim up to twice for a single attack. You may dodge while Aiming, though this increases the Speed of your Dodge action by 3\.

Name: Chain-Blade  
Type: Major  
Effects: For those who like to get up close and personal, and find that the C.A.N.N.O.N. robs them of that experience, there is always the Chain-Blade. A heavyset titanium blade installed directly into your forearm with a chain wrapped around its edges that carries a set of dozens of razor-sharp oscillating metal teeth. These teeth are able to grind through any material which comes into contact with the Chain-Blade in record times. When you activate this Aug, you expand the Chain-Blade from your forearm, gaining a Medium sized Sword that's considered to have 5+(XP/200) Artisan Points. This weapon requires one free hand.

Name: Talon Hook  
Type: Minor  
Effects: You have installed a rope attachment and a pressurized air propelled launcher to your wrist, allowing you to detach your hand and shoot it towards something far away to grab onto it, then either pull yourself towards, or pull it towards you thanks to the high tensile rope connecting your hand to your arm. When you acquire this Augmentation, you gain the "Talon Hook" Action. As a Speed 6 Action, you can target an inanimate object like a wall or a tree, then you automatically hit, and begin pulling yourself towards it at a rate of (STR/40) Yards every 1 IC. While moving in this way, you are unable to use the arm this is attached to.

Name: Rocket Punch  
Type: Minor  
Effects: You have turned your fists into detachable segments with rocket propellants installed at the joints. Giving you the miraculous ability to shoot off your arm in the form of a rocket\! This is used alongside any melee-range Unarmed or Combo Attack of C-rank or lower, and increases that action's Stamina and Speed by 2 each. Your range for that attack becomes the distance you could travel with the Move with an Attack maneuver and you are unable to move as a part of this attack. After it’s fired your fist instantly returns to your arm through magnets and other physics.

Name: Instrumental Digits  
Type: Minor  
Effects: You have replaced your fingers with highly precise motors that are capable of changing into a myriad of miniature tools and instruments. All while possessing a far greater range of motion, with stability that is impossible for normal human hands. You are always treated as possessing \+5 Lockpicks that cannot break, as well as a screwdriver, adjustable wrench, lighter, laser pointer, a pen, scissors, and an always fully charged Flashlight. Additionally, when attempting any sort of sleight of hand feat such as pick pocketing, discreetly placing an explosive tag onto somebody, or even throwing Flash Bombs, you roll Espionage twice and use the higher result.

Name: Remote Eye  
Type Minor  
Effects: You have installed a miniature screen on your forearm that holds inside of it a compartment with a nail sized eye-like device that consists of a camera and a mic. You can remove the Remote Eye from its storage and stick it to any surface, and so long as you are within a half-mile radius, you can monitor anything that the Remote Eye sees and hears through the screen in your arm. The Eye can be detected, but requires an opposed Awareness roll vs your Espionage, and if it is detected can be detected as a simple Speed 1 Action. If it is destroyed, then it takes 1 month to replace. Additionally, if you have the Memory Bank Augmentation, you gain the ability to display your memories for others to see on the monitor screen.

#### **Legs**

Name: Demolitioners  
Type: Major  
Effects: You have installed incredibly powerful pneumatic jackhammers into your legs, allowing you to send destructive shockwaves through a single, powerful step. When you acquire this Augmentation, you gain the "Tremor Step" Action listed below:

Stamina: 18  
Damage: (STR/10)D20  
Area: 20 centered on self  
Speed: 15  
Tags: Blunt, AoE, Grounded

Effects: This attack cannot be Parried even through Nin-Parries. Additionally, structures in its Area take double Damage.

Name: Thigh & Calf Actuators  
Type: Minor  
Effects: You have enhanced your muscles, spine, and ligaments with synthetic reinforcements so that you can overcharge your body for a short period of time. Once per fight as a Speed 0 action you can increase your agility by 30% then for the next 60 IC your agility reduces by 1% every IC. Additionally you increase your speed by the same amount (in percent).

Name: Insecta Striders  
Type: Minor  
Effects: You have replaced your legs with reverse jointed bionic legs that form  a complex system of extreme-tension springs, latches, and hydraulics connecting your thighs to your calves which happen to resemble the limbs of grasshoppers. When the system is engaged, the hydraulics will start to slowly compress the springs, inputting what amounts to several tons of force into them over a series of several seconds, storing all of that latent energy until it's ready to release it all into a burst of explosive force that'll send you flying great distances in superhuman leaps. When you acquire this Augmentation, you gain the "Stride" Action: As a Speed 10, Delay 10 Action, you are able to jump (AGI/10\*PDB) Yards vertically, or half that distance horizontally. Additionally, you may add a Delay 10 to any Attack that you perform so long as its Final Speed is 10 or higher. If you do so, then the "Move with an Attack" maneuver of that Attack covers double the distance it normally would (You still pay the Ardor Cost this way). This Augmentation also dampens the force of any fall or jump (Otherwise, any leap would break your legs and spine), if you find yourself in an uncontrolled fall (Leaping due the "Stride" Action is NOT considered uncontrolled), you may roll Athletics vs 5+(Yards fallen) and if you succeed you completely negate any fall damage that would have occurred. This does not cost any Ardor to perform.

Name: Oil Hose  
Type: Minor  
Effects: You have installed a tankard into your leg that is filled with a highly oily and flammable substance which you are able to release through digitally controlled sprinklers in your calves to cover the entire area around you. When you acquire this Augmentation, you gain the "Oil Hose" Action: Once per fight as a Speed 8 Action, you are able to cover an Area of 15 Yards centered on you with a layer of very slippery oil which has the same Effects as "Rainwater Slick" (still using your chakra for the TN). Additionally, the oil is highly flammable, and any AoE Katon jutsu will light it aflame, giving everybody in its area (Including potentially you) an Ignite of 8 that can be avoided against as a speed 4 action using your base accuracy.

Name: Spiked Soles  
Type: Minor  
Effects: You have spikes that extend and retract digging into the ground to anchor you to it. You may activate and end this Augmentation as a Speed 2 action. When you activate this Augmentation, your movement speed becomes 0 and you cannot be moved in any way or through any effect. While not activated you reduce all knockback by 20%.

Name: Morphing Soles  
Type: Minor  
Effects: You have installed several synthetic polymer extensions to your feet, allowing you to change their shape and function at a moment's notice. As a Speed 6 action you can activate this Augmentation, choose one between three different forms:

Webbing: Your feet flatten and widen, acting like fins that'll vastly increase speed underwater. Your movement speed on land is halved, but doubled in the water.

Talons: Your feet curve into the shapes of razor sharp talons perfect for carving flesh. You can ignore any ground-based environmental effects that restrict your movement such as Rainwater Slick. Sadly this only works on jutsu of D-rank.

Hooves: Your feet split in two and harden into the shape of hooves. Your movement speed on land is halved, but doubled while climbing.

### **Ammo**

First Caliber Round

This behemoth of a Round, measuring roughly 5 mm in diameter, is expertly engineered to be fired through the electromagnetic accelerator known as the C.A.N.N.O.N. developed by the Organization. Designed as an Anti-Everything bullet, this thing can easily punch a hole through a full-on building from dozens of yards away; and still have enough kinetic energy to easily annihilate the soft, tender flesh of any targets behind said building.

Tags: Projectile, Piercing  
Cost: 3k Ryo

Armor Piercing Round

These Armor-Piercing Rounds are constructed with narrow, sharpened tips of hardened materials, such as tungsten, to ensure maximum penetration power. Upon impact, the Round is designed to maintain its shape and integrity, allowing it to easily penetrate through solid materials and any targets without deformation or significant loss in velocity. This, unfortunately, does cause it to frequently over-penetrate, leading to less overall soft-tissue damage.

Special: This shot ignores all of the target's DR and Armor.  
Tags: Projectile, Piercing  
Cost: 6k Ryo

Hollow-Point Round

Designed with a cavity centrally located on the forward end of the bullet, the jacketed Hollow-Point of this Round is meant to fragment into several smaller pieces upon penetration so as to shred through the maximum amount of soft tissue possible. Unfortunately, the reduced mass and fragile nature of this bullet does mean that it is highly ineffective against any hard targets such as Armor.

Special: This Shot applies Bleeding 6 to any target hit. Any DR or Armor that the Target has reduces this Shot's Damage by double their normal value.  
Tags: Projectile, Slashing  
Cost: 10k Ryo
