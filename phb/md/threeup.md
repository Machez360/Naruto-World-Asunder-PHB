# 3 Point Uniques

### **Regenerative Chakra**

You have a seemingly inexhaustible supply of chakra. You might push yourself to your limit, but within minutes your chakra reserves will have replenished themselves. During combat in particular, it's noticeable that your energy seems to have no limit.

You have a \+5 bonus to Chakra Exhaustion rolls. Whenever you spend a point of Willpower, your Chakra Exhaustion penalty is reset to 0; you can also choose to spend a point of Willpower specifically for this purpose immediately before making a Chakra Exhaustion roll.

When using one or more techniques with an Upkeep, the total Upkeep is reduced by 1+CHA/30, to a minimum of half its normal value. Additionally, once per battle you may fail a Chakra Exhaustion check and advance one less Fatigue level (though your penalties do not reset).

You have (your max Willpower) chakra points each battle.

You may spend these to improve the result of a Chakra Exhaustion roll on a 1:1 basis after seeing the result. As you are worn down progressively, your body tries to compensate by producing even more chakra. As a result, your ninjutsu damage bonus is increased by your Fatigue level.

### **Relentless**

You don't stop, you don't quit, and you absolutely don't give up. Those would be great, admirable traits, except for you it only really applies when it comes to brutalizing other human beings.

Every time you hit someone with a damaging attack, you get a \+3 bonus to your damage bonuses (Such as PDB, NDB, SDB) for the purposes of damage only up to a maximum of double their normal values (not counting temporary or situational modifiers such as Chakra Strengthening or Skirmisher respectively for determining this maximum). This bonus resets when you miss with an attack, target someone you did not hit in the previous attack with a non-AoE attack, or you are Stunned. 

When you miss with an attack, the bonus above reset but your next action comes sooner, as if the Speed of the action you used was half its actual value. For example, if you missed with a Speed 13 attack on IC 30, your next action would come on IC 37, rather than IC 43\. Every time this happens, your next DAMAGING attack gets a cumulative \+2 Accuracy, to a maximum of \+6; hitting someone resets this bonus.

### **Surging Power**

You have a dauntless ability to push yourself harder to meet the odds, no matter what the situation. Even when you should be sprawled in the dirt unable to move a single muscle, somehow you stand back up and summon more force from your body.

Whenever you use the Ability Surge on an attack, you can choose to pay a Stamina cost rather than AP. Making a Stamina Check of 5+AP cost you would have paid. This check is handled before the Fatigue Check of the attack. This may not be used alongside normal Surge.

Additionally, whenever you take a wound, you can choose to spend a point of Willpower to ignore all effects of that wound for the remainder of the battle. If you choose to not negate the wound, then you gain a point of temporary willpower instead, this point of temporary willpower is replaced once you take another wound if you haven’t used it by then.

When you fatigue, you somehow find yourself with a new wave of vigor and energy. Every fatigue level, your Stamina Bonus increases by 3 more than it normally does. Meaning that going from Fatigue 0 to Fatigue 1, you gain \+8 to Stamina Bonus rather than \+5. And at Fatigue 2 it’s \+16 rather than \+10.

You reduce the penalties to Accuracy and defensive rolls from fatigue by your current Willpower. So, at 3 Fatigue with 4 Willpower remaining you would go from \-3 Accuracy and \-6 defensive rolls to no Accuracy penalty and \-2 defensive rolls.

### **Tactician**

You understand inherently that all warfare is based on deception and careful, meticulous strategy. If your enemy is secure at all points, you are prepared for him. If he is in superior strength, you can evade him. If your opponent is temperamental, you seek to irritate him. You pretend to be weak, that he may grow arrogant. And strong, that he may grow hesitant. If he is taking his ease, you give him no rest. If his forces are united, you know how to separate them. You attack him where he is unprepared, and appear where you are not expected. With such a gift, you can do something far more miraculous than simply defeating a foe. You can make your enemies defeat themselves. Controlling their actions just as absolutely as you control the actions of your own forces. This is a once in a generation talent, worth far more than any measure of personal strength. A single strong Shinobi may be able to win a hundred battles. But you? You can win wars.

Whenever an enemy performs an action or interrupt, and after they've declared how much AP they're spending, you can increase the Speed of their action as a Speed 1 interrupt which may be used additionally to an actual Defensive Interrupt. Spending 2 AP for every 1 Speed increase up to a max of one and a half of the Base Speed. They may not spend further AP to reduce it.

You may spend 15 AP when performing a Defensive Interrupt and increasing that Interrupt’s Speed by 2  to replace the Base Accuracy of an enemy's attack with an Accuracy roll. If the resulting total is higher than their Base Accuracy, they'll use their Base ACC instead for that attack. If the enemy already uses Accuracy rolls, then instead they roll 2d20 and take the lowest result.

You also receive the benefits of Leader.
