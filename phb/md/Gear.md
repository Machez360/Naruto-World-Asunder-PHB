# **Gear**

## **Ninja Tools**

### **Blank Scroll**

A large scroll. Most of the time these are carried rolled up to save space. They're useless, aside from the fact that a few sealing jutsu make use of them.

Cost: 2.5k Ryo

### **Blood Increasing Pill**

These pills contain a peculiar mix of chemicals that, when consumed by someone capable of using chakra (such as a ninja) will allow their body to rapidly replenish lost blood. When you take one of these pills you regain RES/10 HP (but not Vitality) each IC, for 50 IC. During this duration you take only one third damage from poison, and no damage from effects caused by bleeding (such as certain wounds). Using a Blood Pill is a Speed 10 action.

Cost: 10k Ryo

### **Caltrops**

Small bits of metal that are basically just four short spikes attached at a center; no matter how they land, there'll always be a metal spike pointing upwards. The typical use is to scatter them across the ground to impede movement through an area. 

You can deploy Caltrops as a Speed 5, Area 5, Range 5 action. 

Anyone that moves as part of an attack into, within or out of the caltrops’ area, suffers Piercing damage equal to 5d4+25.

You can deploy Caltrops as a Speed 1 Interrupt anytime you suffer from a Knockback effect of at least 5 Yards. When used in this manner, the Caltrops’ area center is always 5 yards away from the attacker in the direction of the Knockback (that means the attacker is always at the edge of the area, and the area is always between the attacker and the defender). This responsive use of the Caltrops still have the range of 5 yards. This means that if used in response to a ranged knockback attack, your caltrop throw will place caltrops between yourself and your opponent with the center placed up to 5 yards away from you.

Cost: 2k Ryo for enough caltrops to cover one 5 yard area

### **Cloth**

Broad, sturdy cloth that looks like bandages, or perhaps mummification wraps. This comes in large rolls of up to 200 yards; carrying more than one roll inflicts a \-1 immobilization penalty for each beyond the first (not due to weight, but because they're bulky). Confine Scroll Seals can carry one roll each.

Cost: 300 Ryo per yard.

### **Container, Small**

A container, usually a gourd, clay jug, or waterskin, commonly worn at the hip. One container can hold 2 gallons of water or another substance. For every two small containers or fraction thereof beyond the second, you suffer a \-1 penalty to dodge due to encumberance.

Cost: 5k Ryo

### **Container, Large**

A large gourd or other sort of container, several feet long and usually worn on the back. It's heavy and bulky, but not quite enough to restrict the mobility of a well-trained shinobi. It can hold up to 8 gallons of water, but you can only carry one with you (due to its size\!).

Cost: 15k Ryo

### **Flash Bomb**

Flash bombs are devices which, when ignited, produce brilliant flashes of light. Anyone who doesn't know to close their eyes when you throw one suffers a \-4 visibility penalty for the next 10 IC. You can throw these up to STR/5 yards. Throwing one is a Speed 4 action.

You may also drop a flash bomb when dodging, in which case your dodge's Speed is increased by 4\. Flash bombs have an Area of 10 and if used with a dodge the User is the center of it.

Every time you throw a flash bomb as part of a dodge, after the first time it’s been done, you need to succeed at an opposed espionage check vs your opponent for them to not know to close their eyes in time. They have a bonus of \+3 to this roll for every time they’d already had to take this roll in this fight.

Cost: 3k Ryo

### **Ninja Wire**

High tension 16-gauge wire. It is generally only available in ninja villages, and comes in spools with various lengths of wire.

Cost: 1.5k Ryo per 5 Yards.

### **Rope**

I refuse to explain what this is. Individual lengths of rope can be purchased up to 300 feet (100 yards), but there's nothing stopping you from tying a few together. Tying somebody up requires 10 yards of rope, and the person in question to not be resisting.

You can tie someone up with ropes. If so, roll Espionage \+10 to see how good your knots were. The result, or 20, is the TN for escaping. The user can try to slip the knots (Espionage skill roll, \+DEX/10) which takes 5 minutes to attempt (they can hide that they are doing so via an opposed Espionage roll). This can be attempted repeatedly.

You can also attempt to snap the ropes using brute force. This calls for a roll of 1d20 \+ (Athletics /5) \+ (STR /10) against a TN of 30, requires a Stamina 25 roll, and is done instantly, but repeated attempts cannot be made (either you're strong enough to break the ropes, or you're not).

Cost: 1k Ryo per 5 Yards.

### **Smoke Bomb**

Paper balls small enough to be easily held in one hand, when thrown at the ground they burst and release wide clouds of smoke. Smoke bombs have a range of STR/5 yards, and can be thrown as a Speed 4 action. When thrown, it releases a cloud of thick smoke that causes a \-6 visibility penalty to all people within its 5 yard radius, for 20 IC. Once 10 ICs have passed, the Visibility penalty of the Smoke Bomb is halved. 

Cost: 3k Ryo

### **Custom Smoke Bombs**

Once someone's a Chuunin, they have enough pull to get these: smoke bombs designed to your own specifications\! Very nice, and such. For pricing, first determine the 'level' of smoke bomb you want, which starts at 0 and is modified by...

Visibility Penalty: \-4 (+0), \-6 (+2), or \-8 (+3)  
Duration: 15 IC (+1), 20 IC (+2), 25 IC (+3), or 30 IC (+5)  
Radius: 5 yards (+1), 10 yards (+2), or 25 yards (+3)  
Range: STR/5 yards (+0), STR/4 yards (+1), or STR/3 yards (+2)

Requires: Chunnin Rank  
Cost: Level\*1k Ryo

### **Poison Smoke Bomb**

Sturdier than regular smoke bombs, and much more dangerous, these are filled with some manner of poisonous vapor. They're used like regular smoke bombs, but have a 10 yard radius, a \-4 visibility penalty, and persist for 25 IC. When you buy a poison smoke bomb, select a poison (from the Poisons section) which has Inhalation as one of its possible vectors of delivery. When you throw the smoke bomb, make a Toxicology roll. Anyone who passes through the area must make a Resistance roll against that Toxicology result, or be poisoned.

Cost: 10k Ryo \+ Dose of Poison

### **Soldier Pill**

The proper name is 'military ration pills', but the term soldier pill is more commonly used among shinobi. They're less rations than fast-acting performance-enhancing drugs. Though every village has a slightly different recipe, the pills are all marble-sized and black or dark brown. When eaten, they have the approximate flavor and texture of sawdust.

These pills are essentially just condensed stimulants and nutrients; taking one immediately lowers you a Fatigue category, and \+10 your next Chakra Exhaustion or Stamina roll. Doing so is a Speed 10 action in battle. You may only take one per battle, and no more than RES/50 per day.

Cost: 25k Ryo

## **Survival**

### **Antidote**

Antidotes to several of the more popular and lethal poisons which shinobi use are widely available, for somewhat obvious reasons. A single dose of an antidote costs half the amount for a single dose of a poison; multiple doses cost half as much as the first.

For the purposes of Shadow Snake Hands from the Snake Contract, you may assume the first dose of Antidote for each poison to be 7.5k ryo.

Taking a dose of an antidote is a Speed 6 action, and immediately cures you of the poison in question and all its lingering effects. Antidotes that act quickly enough to be useful in emergencies, such as combat, aren't gentle on the body, applying a \-2 penalty to your Accuracy and all d20 rolls for 100 IC. However, for that duration you are immune to the poison in question. Antidotes used in succession do not stack the penalties, but they do refresh the duration.

Cost: Varies

### **Compass**

A small, typically handheld device that has a needle inside a metal case (with a glass cover, so it can be seen) that points, approximately, to magnetic north when held level. These aren't exactly precise, but they're good enough most of the time. Notably, they can have trouble working underground or if they get zapped by a lightning jutsu. When trying to navigate the wilderness, having a compass gives a \+2 bonus to any Survival rolls. If you also have a map of the country you're in, this is raised to \+4. 

Cost- 2.5k Ryo 

**Map**

A map of a given country. It's usually a really, really good for  
at least one person on every ninja team to have a map of any  
country they expect to be going through. These have only  
basic information about terrain, landmarks, and settlements.  
Maps come with scroll cases for ease and safety of  
Transportation.

A map gives a \+4 bonus to any Survival rolls  
made in the appropriate country, within reason (they would  
help tracking someone, or finding shelter, but not exploring  
the inside of a cave).

Cost- 5k Ryo

### **First Aid Kit**

A collection of bandages, ointments, and antiseptics. First aid kits can be used to stop bleeding. They can also cure non-Wound Based Bleed and Burns, with a Speed of 2 per level of severity. A single first aid kit can do each of those once before being expended.

Alternatively, it can treat a wound (in the sense of, "this wound has penalty X until treated, and then only penalty Y"). This is a Speed 15 action per wound category, and completely consumes the first aid kit.

Cost: 2.5k Ryo

### **Flare**

A handy little pyrotechnic device, a cylinder usually a bit too large to fit comfortably in the palm. When lit (most have built in starters or strikers, to avoid the need for matches) they shine brilliantly, enough that it can be painful to look directly at them without squinting, and become blisteringly hot. They burn out quickly, within half a minute.

The vast majority of flares are projectiles, with built-in propellant. Aimed upwards, they'll launch into the air. During the day, this is typically unnoticed if you're doing anything other than staring at the spot it's launched up waiting to see it, and know exactly where it will be. In twilight and darker conditions, however, a flare can be seen for a considerable distance; they're often used for signalling, though suffer from not being too discrete.

Cost: 4k Ryo

### **Flashlight**

Flashlights are popular because ninja like to be able to see in low-light environments\! They're also useful because they can be turned off, or on, as needed. Quite handy for staying hidden when you hear unwanted company approaching.

Flashlights have a battery life of about half an hour. A spare set of batteries (for another half hour of use) costs 500 Ryo.

Cost: 4k

### **Glow Stick**

A transparent small (around six inches long, usually) cylinder filled with chemicals that, when mixed, glow brightly. A swift blow to the stick (usually striking it against one's knee; simply bending it with enough force will also work) will shatter the internal glass dividers, mixing the chemicals and producing a pleasing illumination.

A glow stick will glow for about an hour; it cannot be turned off once activated, short of breaking it completely and letting the luminescent fluid inside it drain out (in which case you just have a glowing puddle). They're available in a variety of colors, with the most popular ones being green and blue.

Cost: 2k

### **Oxygen Mask**

This is a small 'mask' that covers the wearer's mouth and nose, and is held in place by elastic bands which form an airtight seal. Rather than filtering air out, it has two possible fixtures (usually one on each side of the mouth) for an oxygen tank to be attached. 

When wearing the mask, the user has a \-3 penalty to all Stamina rolls, as it takes a slight effort to breathe through it. Putting this on in combat is a Speed 5 action, or \+2 Speed if used as part of an Interrupt. Removing the mask is a Speed 5 action.

Wearing an oxygen mask with at least tank attached makes the wearer immune to external suffocation penalties (being inside an unbreathable cloud would not affect them; being physically choked would) and provides a \+8 bonus to Resistance rolls against statuses that would be inflicted by breathing something in (such as poison mist); the mask is not perfectly air-tight.

Cost: 20k Ryo

### **Oxygen Tank**

Tanks of compressed, breathable air, usually strapped to one's back. They're basically useless by themselves, but each comes with a hose that can be attached to an oyxgen mask. Each tank provides 30 minutes of breathable air.

Cost: 10k Ryo per tank

## **Infiltration**

### **Camouflage Kit**

Everything you need to blend in with the environment, like a truly sneaky ninja. These come in four flavors: forest/plains, desert, mountainous/rocky, and 'other' (covering anything not one of those). A kit may only be used in its corresponding environment.

Using a kit takes 15 minutes, and is enough to conceal a person at level 3 Stealth; the stealth roll is made after they're fully hidden. The exact contents are fairly nonspecific, but regardless, each kit is good for only one use.

Cost: 15k Ryo

### **Camera**

Cameras are rare devices, and ones suited for use by ninja even more so. Styles vary, but they are all small, and usually handheld. However, they are large enough that they cannot be effectively concealed while in use. The exact designs may vary greatly, though Sunagakure is fond of a model worn like a circlet on the head, with the lens covering one eye.

Most models include a flash that allows blurry pictures to be taken in the dark. Each image uses a single piece of film, acquired separately. Facilities to develop the film are rare, but exist in all major shinobi villages, along with trained staff who will do so overnight for urgent matters, or within a week for personal needs.

Cost: 50k Ryo

### **Camera Film Roll**

These are specially treated, light-sensitive pieces of paper. A single roll of Camera Film is good for 10 pictures. Due to the lack of standardization among models, pieces of film generally cannot be exchanged from one camera to another. These are usually stored inside the camera itself; if exposed to light before capturing an image they become useless, though afterwards there will be no effects from direct light on the paper.

Cost: 5k Ryo

### **Grappling Hook**

A three- or four-pronged sturdy metal hook. The typical use is to attach it to the end of a rope then throw it over a wall, up a tree, or across a small chasm, and hope it catches on something (such as a piece of architecture, a branch, or an appropriately-shaped rock). The user then climbs the rope to get to their destination\!

These see limited use among experienced ninja, who typically have ways of easily doing the same thing, but beginners often find them useful, and they can be situationally helpful even for more advanced shinobi.

Cost: 1.5k Ryo

### **Lockpicks**

A set of small tools, easily carried in a pocket, used for opening locks in absence of the key. These allow an Espionage roll to be made to open a lock, and also provide a bonus to said roll. That bonus has a maximum of \+5, or the user's Espionage skill ranks, whichever is lower; you have to actually know how to use them to get any benefit. These are reusable, though a roll of 5 or lower on the Espionage check means they break in the attempt (which may still be successful).

Cost: 10k Ryo per \+1

### **Ninja Comm Device**

The pinnacle of technological advancement in the ninja world, these are small wireless radios. They're typically worn as headsets with an ear insert and a microphone held suspended near the wearer's mouth. Normal comm devices can be tuned to transmit and receive on any of a dozen frequencies by the user, allowing any set of devices to be synchronized with one another. Though each village also has a few sets of specially made comm devices built to operate on "secure" frequencies, these are not typically given to shinobi on missions.

Commonly used in missions that require precise coordination or infiltration, these always receive, and are touch-activated to broadcast. They have a range of half a mile.

Be aware that while these are generally a secure means of communication, it's (theoretically) possible for enemies to find your frequency if you're making continual use of the comms, they know you're using them, and they're actively trying to do so.

If you suffer a Major or greater Head wound while wearing a comm device, it breaks as a result of the damage. A comm device broken this way is too badly damaged to be repaired, and will need to be replaced.

Cost: 25k Ryo

### **Telescope**

A small pocket telescope, which telescopes out from two inches to close to six. It allows you to effectively see what's going on up to a mile away, and read reasonably sized text (assuming you have clear line of sight) up to half a mile away. Mechanically, this means that any Awareness rolls at a distance up to its maximum (to, say, see when a guard leaves his post) have no penalty.

Cost: 10k Ryo
