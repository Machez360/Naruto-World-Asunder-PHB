# **Rank Benefits**

Rank benefits are specialized abilities acquired when one ranks up. Each rank will have several for you to choose from; you automatically acquire any two of your choice, for free. These represent the fact that while all shinobi of a given rank will have similar overall capabilities, there's room for different ninja to have widely varying areas of expertise.

Some benefits can only be taken by members of certain villages, as indicated by a label of "(village) Only".

The rank benefits Leader and Mentor are gained automatically and do not count towards the two chooses for their respective ranks.

## **Chuunin**

### **Leader**

You're exceptionally good at properly using and allocating your human resources. When you are the designated leader of a group, you may activate this benefit up to XP/250 times per in-character week.

When you do so, you can give an order to one person (or use multiple activations to give orders to multiple people). They have a \+3 bonus to any relevant rolls to following that order. If the order was to perform a specific action, if applicable it will have \+3 Accuracy.

These orders must be specific. "Do what you think is best" would not qualify. If you told someone to "hold this position", that would not give them the bonus to all combat rolls. "Attack that person" wouldn't qualify, but "restrain them somehow" would.

Generally speaking, a single instance of this benefit will benefit only a single roll or attack.

### **Nindo**

You have a nindo, or ninja way, that you hold as more important than anything else. It gives you strength and guidance when you find yourself in need of either. This can be something like never leaving a comrade behind (even if they promise they can, and probably can, handle themselves) or never allowing yourself to have an unfair advantage (if a stronger opponent is missing their left arm, holding yours behind your back for the entire fight). The GMs must approve your Nindo.

Once per two months (eight real-life days), while actively following our nindo (such as fighting alongside that ally, or in the battle with that enemy), you can activate this benefit. Doing so resets your Chakra Exhaustion and Stamina penalties to 0, and lowers your Fatigue by two categories.

However, if you ever act against your Nindo (even if it's the best decision to make, or just following orders) you cannot use its effects for three months (twelve real-life days).

### **Unrelenting**

You profoundly don't like to give up; when you set your mind to doing something, you do it as it has never been done before. You can spend multiple points of Willpower (or activations of Limit Break, or things that work similarly) on a single roll. There is no limit to how many times you may do so for one action, beyond how many Willpower you have to spend.

### **Will of Fire \- Leaf Only**

What brings Leaf ninja together and in some ways makes them the strongest of all the ninja villages--though none would admit this--is their camaraderie. That they are more or less a giant family and protect one another as such is why the Leaf ninja prospere.

Whenever an ally is Severely or Critically Wounded, or brought to 0 HP, something sparks within you, motivating you in the defense of one another and the village. Starting immediately, and lasting for (maximum Willpower)\*5 IC after your next non-Interrupt action, you do not accumulate penalties to Fatigue, and status effects which you are currently afflicted with are ignored. Any Genjutsu which is affecting you is purged altogether, and you have a \+5 bonus to defensive Genjutsu rolls in this time. Multiple instances of Will of Fire overlap, but do not stack.

### **Mist Born \- Mist Only**

Training to fight in low-light environments is something that every village's ninja academy and instructors covers at least briefly. Mist puts more of an emphasis on that than others, some say because of the thick, choking fogs that often engulf their island home, others arguing it's a result of the networks of caverns under the island that students and genin often train under.

Many Mist shinobi train themselves to be particularly adept at fighting with reduced, or even no, visibility. They adapt to low-light conditions quickly, their eyes adjusting or other senses taking over as necessary. Every 10 IC you spend suffering from a visibility penalty of any severity, the maximum visibility penalty you can suffer from is lowered by 1, applied after Blind Fighting, to a minimum of \-2. For example, if you were inside the range of a Hidden Mist Technique for 20 IC, and had 3 ranks of Blind Fighting, the maximum visibility penalty (from any source) you could suffer from would be (10-3-2) \= 5\.

However, every 10 IC you spend not suffering from any visibility penalties, this bonus decays by 1\. In the above example, after 20 IC your Mist Born bonuses would have dissipates entirely.

If you have closed your eyes, blindfolded yourself or something similar, Mist Born does not take effect. Wounds and jutsu which temporarily blind you, however, still trigger it. For area-of-effect visibility penalties, you must actually be in the area.

### **Desert Adaptation \- Sand Only**

The desert is not a welcoming or forgiving climate. Those who call it home do not consider it an enemy, but also harbor no illusions about just how quickly their homeland will end their lives if they let it. They learn to overcome adversity, because in the desert, there is no other way.

As a Speed 0 action you can activate or deactivate this village benefit. While active, you halve all penalties from Fatigue and Status Effects. Thus, Immobilization 8 would give you only \-4 accuracy and defenses and \-40% movement speed; Visibility 6, however, would still allow people to hide from you. This specifically does not apply to any Damage Dealing Effects, such as Bleed, Ignite, and Poison.

You may maintain this effect for a total of 50 IC during a battle. These 50 ICs do not have to be consecutive.

### **Stoneheart \- Iwa Only**

As an Iwagakure ninja you refuse to show weakness and will do whatever it takes to remain standing. Once per fight in response to taking damage from an attack you may advance a fatigue level to half the final damage taken. You may choose to activate this effect even after you've seen the action's normal results.

You are also adept at encouraging your allies to push past their normal limitations uniting to be stronger together. Every 50 IC you may end any stuns or paralysis you're ally has by paying 1 AP per 2 stun and 3 AP per level of paralysis they're inflicted with.

### **Storm's Resilience \- Kumo Only**

All residents of Kumogakure endure conditioning to withstand the harsh weather conditions of the village. Due to its high altitude and intense atmosphere you gain a better grasp of Resilience in high profile combat, keeping up won't naturally be an Issue for you, every time you Rest, you reduce your Stamina penalty by 1 additional point, and reduce your Suffocation by a value equal to the amount of Stamina reduction you have. Furthermore you may spend Willpower to reroll Fatigue Checks as you would other rolls.

## **Jounin**

### **Experienced Shinobi**

You've been doing this ninja thing for a while, and it's second nature to you by now. If you could, based on only your DEX and Uniques, reduce the Seal Speed of a ninjutsu you know to 0 , then you can perform that jutsu without needing to use handseals.

Limited use effects (Which mostly have been removed except for some outliers) do not apply to this. So only effects/bonuses that are always active you get. This doesn't apply to Genjutsu, Sealing Ninjutsu, or Medical Ninjutsu.

### **Mentor**

It's sort of expected that jounin will help teach the next generation of shinobi; indeed, that's why many are given teams of genin to watch over and train. Anyone can explain a concept, but you can actually do so well. You'd make a great instructor, truth be told.

You can train other shinobi. This can be done with jutsu, in which case it takes one week per rank of the technique, during which time you and the student can still go on missions and about your regular business, but must be able to spend a reasonable amount of time practicing. This allows a person to learn techniques of one rank beyond their normal imitation, and can only be done with jutsu that you know yourself.

For example, if you knew a B-rank Katon jutsu, you could teach it to a Chuunin if they spent at least four weeks around you, learning it.

You may also teach any talents under the "Capabilities" heading which you already know. Doing this requires ten weeks of training with your student. After training is complete, they learn it normally. However, their next talent must be spent to pay for whatever it was they learned, and they may only be one talent in "debt" at a time. For example, say you were mentoring a student with 1100 XP, who used their first talent to acquire Seal Training. After ten weeks they would be able to learn, for example, Medical Training. At 2500 XP the talent point they'd normally get would be used to "pay for" the Medical Training they received early.

Keep the GMs informed of who you're training, and with what. There are Infamy gains associated, for both teacher and student. And, notably, teaching members of other villages is looked upon very poorly by your own village and, if they find out, can be tantamount to treason.

### **Staying Power**

All this ninja-ing has given you exceptional resilience. You work yourself to the bone and fight against impossible odds on a regular basis; it's not even really all that memorable when you do it, any more\! Your bonus to Chakra Exhaustion and Stamina rolls from Fatigue is raised by \+2 per category (from a default of \+5, giving you, under normal circumstances, \+7 per Fatigue level).

### **Trusted Tactician**

You lead your team into battle using strategy and tactics to ensure victory. Once every 50 IC, as a Speed 10 Action, that cannot be reduced with AP,  you can call out two Orders during a Combat encounter. Whenever you make one of these Orders, your allies must make an immediate decision on whether to Obey the order or Disobey. If they choose to Disobey, they continue acting as normal but don't gain any of the benefits of the Order. However, if they decide to Obey, then they must use all of their Actions whenever they can to follow the Order given. The orders are as follows:

Fallback: Your allies receive \+3 to dodge any attack while they maneuver around the battlefield; The allies that Obey this Order can perform any Action or Jutsu they wish that allows them to get out of the Battlefield faster, but may not take any hostile Actions.

Focus: Your ally gains \+2 accuracy on the next attack made against an enemy within 3 yards of you.

Regroup: Your ally increases their movement by 25% towards moving towards you or any space within 3 yards of you.

Hold The Line: Your ally gains a RES/2 temporary reduction in damage taken while within 3 yards of you.

### **Back to the Basics**

Pick one Chuunin rank benefit you don't have. You acquire it.

## **Special Jounin**

### **Skill Mastery**

Choose a single skill which relates to your role as a Special Jounin; Medicine for a medic nin, Survival for a tracker, Chakra Control for a seal specialist, and so forth. You must already have the Specialization ability for that skill. When you roll below a 10 when using that skill, your d20 roll is instead considered to be a 10\. Your maximum skill ranks are also increased by 3\.

You must have GM approval for which skill you take this for. You may take Mastery more than once, each time applied to a different skill.

### **Highly Talented**

Whenever you spend a point of Willpower to reroll a skill roll, you also add 5 points to the final result of the roll. You have one point of "temporary" Willpower, which does not count as one of your maximum WP but is recovered normally, which may only be spent to reroll skill rolls.

### **Absurdly Prepared**

You take the concept of being prepared to its logical conclusion, and then keep going. You don't just have the right tools for any given situation, you have more tools than you know what to do with.

Whenever you spend ryo to obtain an item other than Exploding Tags, you get twice as many of that item. Buying a \+1 lockpick would get you a second set for free. Buying 10 shuriken would instead give you 20 shuriken, and so forth.

### **General Expertise**

Pick a Chuunin or Jounin rank benefit; you receive it. This does not allow you to choose village-exclusive benefits from other villages.

## **ANBU**

### **Assassin**

When you attack an opponent who is completely unaware of your presence (you are in Stealth and they do not know you are hiding from them; thus, this cannot be used if you hide from them mid-battle) your attack has \+4 Accuracy and \+25% damage.

Additionally, you can prepare sneak attacks at twice the regular speed. Thus, when aborting a Prepare Sneak Attack action to perform a Sneak Attack, the duration of your Perform Sneak Attack action only needs to be at least half the Speed of the action you're using as a Sneak Attack.

### **Deadly Reflexes**

It's impossible to catch you off guard. You react without even needing time to think about what you're doing, letting yourself process the situation and get your bearings mid-battle. No matter what your Initiative roll at the start of battle, your first action is always on IC 0\.

### **Critical Strike**

You know the value of a single, decisive blow at the right moment. It ends battles--and lives. When attacking, if partial defense applies to your attack's damage you may spend 1 point of Willpower and cause all effects of partial defense to be ignored for that attack.

This is declared before you roll damage, and does allow your opponent to, in response, spend a Willpower point of their own on their defense. If this causes them to avoid your attack after all, your point of Willpower is not spent.

This may only be used successfully once per battle. Remember, you can only spend 1 point of Willpower on a single action; thus, if you had already used a point of Willpower to roll your Accuracy, you couldn't spend a second one for Critical Strike.

### **Hunter Nin \- Mist Only**

You may designate a single person as your quarry. Doing so requires a week to study any available information on them and to, through a mixture of not getting enough sleep and mild meditation, get yourself in the proper mindset.

You have \+6 to Survival rolls to track your quarry, and \+5 to Awareness and Espionage rolls made against them. Your Accuracy for attacks made against them is increased by 3, and your damage by 25% for the purpose of determining wounds. When fighting them, you have 1 point of temporary Willpower, and gain another point of temporary Willpower every 50 IC.

It takes four weeks of mentally detaching yourself from the hunt to end the quarry status of a person, be it because you've killed them or given up the hunt. You may only designate one person as your quarry at a time.

### **Extensive Training**

Pick a Chuunin or Jounin rank benefit; you receive it.
