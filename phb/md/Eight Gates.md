# **The Eight Gates**

## **Introduction**

Inside the human body there are eight gates which regulate the flow of energy through the person's chakra circulatory system. They have the function of self-imposed biological limiters, preventing a person from catastrophically overexerting themselves.

Ninja, however, are nothing if not cheerily self-destructive. Inevitably, shinobi found the way to forcibly, temporarily "open" these gates. The result is a surge of chakra flow through the body, and an accompanying spike in physical performance.

The downside is that accessing the gates pushes the human body well beyond its tolerance. While being able to access the gates for a brief surge of power does provide a substantial tactical advantage, doing so for even a short time can seriously injure the user.

As mentioned, there are eight gates, but learning how to open each one is an endeavor unto itself; knowing how to open the first and second gates doesn't mean you understand the third.

## **Rules**

Each gate confers its own set of benefits and abilities which you receive and can use while it's open, described under the individual gate's effects. You only gain access to individual gates at specific XP thresholds as listed below:

* First Gate: 1000 XP  
* Second Gate: 1500 XP  
* Third Gate: 2000 XP  
* Fourth Gate: 2500 XP  
* Fifth Gate: 4500 XP  
* Sixth Gate: 5000 XP  
* Seventh Gate: 5500 XP  
* Eighth Gate: 6000 XP

When the gates are opened, you have access to a special, second pool of Action Points, starting at 0 and with a maximum of half your normal AP maximum (in other words, AGI/4), called Gate Action Points Pool (GAP Pool).

AP provided by the gates (listed under "AP Gain" in their respective entries) goes into your GAP pool. GAP may only be spent on the following things: 

* Reducing the Speed of taijutsu attacks   
* Abilities provided by the gates   
* The ability Principle of Motion   
* The ability Surge (though if improving Accuracy, only for unarmed attacks) 

Your regular AP may still be spent normally, as well as on abilities provided by the gates.

Once you're able to access the gates, you gain the following two actions:

### **Open Gates**

(Speed 5 \+ 3 \* X, Stamina 15 \+ 5 \* X) You open one or more of the eight gates. By default, this opens only a single gate; you may choose to open several at once, for a total of 1 \+ X gates. Doing this, however, drastically increases the strain put upon your body, causing you to immediately suffer X wounds (as described in Wounding, below).

For example, if you had two gates open, and wanted to open three more, it would be a Speed (5 \+ 3\*2) 11 action, with a Stamina cost of (15 \+ 5\*2) 25, and you'd suffer 2 wounds.

### **Close Gates**

(Speed 5 \+ 5 \* X) You take several moments to calm yourself and stabilize your chakra flow before willing your chakra gates shut. This shuts all open gates, with X being the number currently opened. Unlike opening, closing them is all-or-nothing.

## **Wounding**

As mentioned above, using the gates is devastating, in no small part because doing so gives the user's body the ability to physically tear itself apart. Every time you take an action with a Stamina or Chakra cost while using the gates, you have a chance to wound yourself. That chance is:

(5 \* (gate opened) \+ (final speed) \+ (AP used))%

For example, say you had opened the second gate and used a basic unarmed attack (Speed 8), and spent 4 AP to reduce it down to Speed 4\. After performing your action you'd roll 1d100, and on a roll of (4\*2 \+ 4 \+ 4\) \= 16 or lower, you'd immediately suffer a wound.

These wounds cannot be prevented or reduced in severity. The gates inflict Blunt wounds. When you suffer one, roll for location.

The first wound you suffer on a given location in a single week (OOC day) from the gates is a Minor wound. The second is a Major, the third a Severe, and the fourth a Critical.

For example, if you wounded yourself using the gates six times, and rolled head three times, left arm once, right arm once, and chest once, you'd have:

* A minor, major, and severe head wound  
* Two minor arm wounds  
* And a minor chest wound

For a total of six different wounds.

Additionally, any wound-healing abilities (such as some Medical ninjutsu, or Henzaki Organ Mobility) cannot be used while the gates are still open: you have to close them first.

## **How to Read**

Each gate contains a brief description of what it does, an "AP Gain" number, and an ability.

Every time the IC reaches a multiple of 10, you gain the AP listed under AP Gain, added to your GAP Pool. If that pool is full, any excess AP is simply lost.

You only receive the AP Gain of the highest gate you have open.

Each gate also has a listed ability, such as the first gate's Enhanced Strength and the second gate's Rejuvenation. You have access to the abilities of all opened gates. For example, with the third gate open you would be able to use Enhanced Strength (first), Rejuvenation (second), and Enhanced Power (third).

## **Restrictions**

The eight gates work poorly with weapons, much to the woe of many shinobi. This has a great deal to do with their nature: while they grant overwhelming power, the user's technique tends to suffer as a result. Weapons simply aren't meant to be used by a body tearing itself apart, or swung with that sort of speed and force.

Accordingly, some of the abilities granted by the gates do not work with weapons as well as they do with unarmed attacks. Specifically...

*Enhanced Strength:* Cannot be used with weapons.  
*Enhanced Power:* Cannot be used with weapons.  
*Enhanced Speed:* Does not increase weapon Accuracy.  
*Extreme Speed:* May not be used to raise weapon Accuracy.

Additionally, members of the Hozuki clan cannot access the gates when using their Hydration Technique--their body has no bones, muscles, or circulatory system to enhance.

Activating the technique will not close any open gates, but will suspend all their effects (including AP generation, ability to spend GAP, access to the Gates’ abilities, self wounding, etc) until they have completely reformed.

## **The Gates**

### **The First Gate \- Kaimon \- Gate of Opening**

Located in the brain, opening this gate removes the body's ability to limit the output of its muscles.

AP Gain: 5

*Enhanced Strength*  
You can spend AP to increase your Physical Damage Bonus for a single attack, at the rate of 1 AP per 0.4. You may spend up to STR/10 AP this way.

### **The Second Gate- Kyuumon \- Gate of Healing**

Also located in the brain, the second regulates the body's breakdown of stored energy. By opening it, the body gains the ability to access its energy reserves faster than would normally be physically possible.

AP Gain: 10

*Rejuvenation*  
You may spend AP at any time to reduce your Stamina penalty. Every 2 AP spent reduces your Stamina penalty by 1\.

### **The Third Gate \- Seimon \- Gate of Life**

Located on the spinal cord between the shoulders, opening the third gate results in one's blood vessels dilating, causing increased blood flow throughout the body. Opening this gate also has the effect of turning the user's skin a very marked reddish color.

AP Gain: 15

*Accelerated Bloodflow*  
The increased flow of blood to all regions of your body keeps your cells oxygenated and able to perform at their peak. You reduce your Fatigue penalties by the number of gates you have open. Therefore, if you were at Fatigue 4 with the third gate open, you would have only a \-1 penalty to Accuracy and a \-5 penalty to defenses.

### **The Fourth Gate \- Shoumon \- Gate of Pain**

Located below the Gate of Life, the fourth gate got its name for a very simple reason: beyond what's normal even for the other gates, opening causes severe pain across the entire body as the overwhelming flow of chakra begins physically tearing the user's muscle fibers.

AP Gain: 20

*Enhanced Power*  
For every AP you spend reducing an attack's Speed, you may spend another AP to "buy back" the lowered damage bonus.

For example, say you spent 4 AP to bring a basic unarmed attack from Speed 8 to Speed 4\. Normally you would deal (damage bonus)\*(4) damage with this attack, because its Speed is 4\. However, with Enhanced Power you could spend up to 4 AP increasing its effective Speed. Thus, if you spent 3 AP on Enhanced Power, you'd deal (damage bonus)\*(7) damage.

### **The Fifth Gate \- Tomon \- Gate of Limit**

Located in the middle of the torso, the fifth gate is below the fourth on the spinal column (which also serves as the body's primary chakra meridian). Opening results in a marked increase in speed and power for the shinobi who does so, but begins tearing tendons away from the bones they're anchored to.

AP Gain: 25

*Enhanced Speed*  
Every 5 AP you spend on attack increases its Accuracy by 1\. Every 5 AP you currently have in your gate-specific AP pool gives you a \+1 bonus to dodge rolls.

### **The Sixth Gate \- Keimon \- Gate of View**

Placed in the lower abdomen, the gate of view is responsible for, relative to the previous five, gross regulation of chakra, with the first five gates fine-tuning its distribution to one extent or another.

Simply opening the sixth gate results in the body blasting chakra out from every one of its tenketsu. While it's open the user will radiate a strong artificial 'wind'; trees will bend away, and water will rise to form vortexes around them.

AP Gain: 30

*Extreme Speed*  
After making an attack or attempting to dodge and seeing if it succeeds or fails, you may spend AP to increase its result by 1 for every 10 points of AP spent. Additionally, you may use Enhanced Strength or Enhanced Power after determining if your attack hits.

### **The Seventh Gate- Kyoumon \- Gate of Wonder**

Located near the base of the spine, at hip level, the seventh gate results in the most marked physical changes since the third. The user begins using glowing green sweat from their pores; the amounts of chakra rushing through the user's chakra circulatory system are becoming genuinely destructive to the body, and so it tries to vent it out the only way it can... resulting in glowing green, chakra-infused sweat.

Additionally, merely having this gate open results in shredding one's muscle fibers. While chakra can make up for lost functionality, even a light touch causes severe pain to someone who's opened the seventh gate recently.

AP Gain: 40

*Defiance*  
So long as the Seventh Gate remains open, you ignore the effects of all wounds you're suffering from (though they will still accumulate normally). You need to take two wounds on the same location before the wounds caused by Gates on that location increases in severity. You ignore the normal “Half your max AP” of the GAP pool. You can now practically store as much AP as you wish.

### **The Eighth Gate \- Shimon \- Gate of Death**

Located near the heart, this is the final option for any user of the gates, when accomplishing their goal is more important than their life. With all eight gates opened, there's nothing to regulate the body's chakra flow, and since it's inherently tied to every major organ in the body, there's very little to regulate organ function either.

Opening the eighth gate will cause the user's death, without exception. However, for those few minutes before their heart literally pumps itself to death, before their raging chakra system finishes tearing their organs into pulp, and before they convert vital portions of their body into energy, a user of the eighth gate has unrivaled power.

AP Gain: 50

*Last Stand*  
When you first open the eighth gate, all wounds you are presently suffering from are removed. So long as the Eighth Gate remains open, your HP cannot be reduced below 1\. AP spend on any Gate specific effect or action counts as double the AP. There are no longer any restrictions to any of the Gates effects, such First Gate’s Enhanced Stregnth STR/10 limitation. Every time you take a Non-Interrupt Action, you suffer a Wound.

However, when you fall unconscious, close the Eighth Gate, or when you have accumulated 28 Wounds, you die
