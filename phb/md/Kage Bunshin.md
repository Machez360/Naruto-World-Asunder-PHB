# **Shadow Clones**

## **Kage Bunshin no Jutsu \- Shadow Clone Technique**

Perhaps the pinnacle of development for the ninja replication technique is this jutsu. Whereas bunshin creates what are essentially illusions, shadow clones use chakra to create a perfect copy of the original person.

Despite this, they are fairly delicate and unstable; a solid blow will harm the clone as if it was flesh and blood, but moments later the bunshin will vanish in a puff of smoke.

Speed: 5, \+2 per clone  
Seal Speed: 5, \+2 per clone

Effects:

You may create any number of clones; however, each clone raises your Fatigue level by 1\. You can't regain Fatigue spent on clones so long as they exist. Fatigue level changes caused by creating or ending Kage Bunshin do not reset your Stamina and Chakra Exhaustion penalties. When created, Kage Bunshin have all Wounds and Upkeeps you do, but not status effects. Wounds gained, and Upkeeps activated, after they're created do not automatically transfer to the clones.

Kage bunshin can perform any action other than creating more clones; they can even perform handseals and use jutsu. Kage Bunshin are always at Fatigue 1, and if they fail a Fatigue roll or take any damage they're destroyed.

If a clone is destroyed, you do not get its Fatigue level back. You may, as a Speed 5 \+ 2 \* X action, end 1 \+ X clones. Clones ended this way vanish in a puff of smoke whenever they would next be able to act, and you regain the fatigue level spent on them. (If you had a Clone make a speed 8 basic attack on IC 80, and then on IC 84 you ended the clone, it wouldn't vanish until IC 88, the next time it could take an action.)

Although you do not have a mental link with your clones, when one ceases to exist (either because it's destroyed or because you voluntarily ended it) you gain memories of all the experiences it had in the time when it was separated from you. These memories, while 'legible', seem slightly unreal, the mental equivalent of looking at a photograph's negatives (meaning you can't confuse them with your own "real" memories).

In combat, as mentioned, kage bunshin can act as if they were you. If they are present at the start of battle, they use your initiative roll; otherwise, they may act the IC after they're created.

Mentally commanding your clones to act costs 1 AP per 5 Speed of the action they're going to use. For example, say you made a Shadow Clone, and on IC 80 you wanted it to punch an enemy. This is a Speed 8 action, so you'd spend 2 AP, and your clone couldn't act again until IC 88\.

Defenses declared against attacks from Kage Bunshin do not advance initiative count, but the defense still needs to be speed legal in order to be used.

If, on IC 85, somebody attacked your clone, you could spend 1 AP to have it take a Dodge action (Speed 2), after which you wouldn't be able to give it another non-Interrupt order until IC 90\.

When Kage Bunshin attack they use half your damage bonus on your attacks, and the severity of wounds they inflict is reduced one category.

Clones do not accumulate AP and may spend your AP, with the exception that you may not spend AP to reduce the Speed of their actions.They do not have their own Willpower, but you may spend your own Willpower for them.

When created, Shadow Clones have all your equipment, with the following exceptions:

1\. Consumable items (flash and smoke bombs, poison, Shuriken or Kunai, exploding tags, and so on). Anything which, after being used, cannot be reused.

2\. Chakra-infused items (such as storage scrolls) are physically replicated, but have no special properties.

3\. No electronic items (cameras, comm devices) or items with complex moving parts function.

When created, you may Allocate any amount of your own consumables from your inventory into their own. So, if you had thirty shuriken, and created two clones, you could ensure each had 10 shuriken-but you'd only have 10 left yourself. All items allocated this way are lost if the clone is destroyed, though you may recover the items if you purposefully End the clone.
