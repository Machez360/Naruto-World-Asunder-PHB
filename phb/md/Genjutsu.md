## **E-rank**

### **Senpuku no Jutsu \- Concealment Technique**

This jutsu allows a ninja to conceal small (or sometimes not so-small) items on their person or in their grasp. This is a fantastic technique for smuggling items or transporting them in secrecy, its utility counteracted only by its vulnerabilities.

Chakra: 10  
Upkeep: 2  
Speed: 10  
Seal Speed: 8

Effects:  
This completely hides an object from casual observation. Against a detailed search, it gives a \+5 bonus to any rolls to keep it hidden, and allows the obect to, essentially, hide in plain sight. You have to keep contact with the object, or at least keep it close to you (say, in a belt holster).  
It won't hide it if you're being patted down. If the object interacts with the rest of the world (such as taking a swing with a weapon, or using a key to open a door) the concealment ends.

### **Genkoe \- Hallucinatory Voices**

Despite its name, this technique isn't limited to voices, or even auditory hallucinations. It has no effect at all until the victim begins paying a bit too much attention to their surroundings, at which point the technique begins playing tricks on their senses, causing them to see movement at the corner of their vision and gentle sounds just slightly too vague to place.

Chakra: 12  
Upkeep: 2  
Speed: 7  
Seal Speed: 8

Effects:  
This technique inflicts a \-2 penalty to Awareness rolls. It also halves the bonus for consecutive actions spent searching (so if you Searched three consecutive times with Genkoe applied to you, you'd have a \+3, rather than \+6, bonus on your next roll)

Unlike other Genjutsu which are discovered X \* 3 IC after theyâ€™ve been inflicted, Genkoe is discovered X \* 6 IC afterwards, with X being the amount the victim lost their Genjutsu defense roll by.

### **Mousou Enmu no Jutsu \- Illusory Mist Technique**

Masquerading as a higher-ranked Suiton technique, this creates a light bank of fog which has little effect beyond making the atmosphere a bit chillier. An illusion is then laid on all those present (the user may exclude allies if they wish), tricking them into believing the mist is actually thick enough to be a hindrance.

Chakra: 8  
Upkeep: 2  
Range: Centered on self  
Area: 25  
Speed: 8  
Seal Speed: 7

Effects:  
Anyone who fails a genjutsu roll is placed a \-4 visibility penalty. More insidiously, so long as they remain within the mist they have a \-2 penalty to all their defensive genjutsu rolls.  
People who pass their genjutsu roll still see the mist, but for what it really is: too thin and wispy to actually be an impediment, and also no longer suffer the \-2 Penalty to their Genjutsu Defense.

Anyone who falls under this genjutsu discovers they are under this genjutsu X \* 3 IC after they fall under it, with X being the amount they failed their Genjutsu defense roll by

## **D-rank**

### **Kasumi Juusha no Jutsu \- Mist Servant Technique**

This jutsu creates clones that phase in and out of the ground as if they were made of a blackish, oil-like liquid. When attacked, the clones regenerate themselves. The clones can be controlled to make it seem as if they're attacking. The user can then time their attacks with those of the clones to remain concealed.

Chakra: 10  
Upkeep: 2  
Speed: 14  
Seal Speed: 12

Effects:  
This genjutsu creates dozens of illusions of the user. Anyone in combat with them must 'defend' against this technique with a genjutsu roll. The clones are harmless, and slow-moving, but may feign attacks intermittently.  
When this is used, you are automatically placed in Stealth (as one of the clones). You may attack from stealth normally, but in addition to ranged attacks, you may make any basic weapon or unarmed attack without breaking stealth. Each attack lowers your Stealth TN by 3, rather than 5\. If you take a Hide or Improve Hiding action, this technique's benefits end.  
Once you've been found, you cannot hide among these clones again; you'd need to use the technique once more to do that. This is a clone technique.

Anyone who falls under this genjutsu discovers they are under this genjutsu X \* 3 IC after they fall under it, with X being the amount they failed their Genjutsu defense roll by.

### **Oboro Bunshin no Jutsu \- Haze Clone Technique**

This creates what appear to be ordinary bunshin, even responding and vanishing when struck. However, each time one clone is destroyed another takes its place, typically just out of sight of whoever destroyed its predecessor.

Chakra: 10, \+2 per clone  
Upkeep: 3  
Speed: 8, \+1 per clone  
Seal Speed: 4, \+2 per clone

Effects:  
Effects: You may create up to three clones. This function as normal clones, but you are always 'hidden' among your clones (as per the 'Hide Among Clones' action), even after you've been hit by an opponent.

Taking an Observe action allows an opponent to make a genjutsu roll to realize that this is an illusion (and subsequently may attempt to dispel the illusion with Kai as per an area genjutsu once they successfully realize it), but cannot actually single you out from your clones. Any time a  
clone used in this technique is destroyed, another one appears to take its place and your current chakra exhaustion penalty is increased by 1\.

Clones used in this technique do not get destroyed by AOE attacks, AOE attacks instead just target the original as if no clones had been present.

No initial genjutsu roll is made; opponents are, by default, tricked into believing these are normal clones. However, after the first time they realize this technique for what it is (i.e. an illusion) in battle, they'll also recognize all future uses of it in that same battle as such.

Anyone who falls under this genjutsu discovers they are under this genjutsu X \* 3 IC after they take their first observe action, with X being the amount they failed their Genjutsu defense roll by.

### **Magen: Narakumi no Jutsu \- Demonic Illusion: Hell Viewing Technique**

The user creates an illusion of spinning leaves around the victim, after the leaves disappear, the illusion begins, showing the victim something they'd rather never see, be it a loved one hurt, a monster of their nightmares, or some other such thing. In most cases, it is easy to identify that the image is fake, due to the unlikliness of it occuring, but some images still leave a foul sensation in ones mind.

Chakra: 16  
Range: 25  
Special: Stun 20  
Speed: 12  
Seal Speed: 14

Effects:  
Whatever image this subjects the victim to, the end result is they lose a point of Willpower. After the first time in a day this is (successfully) used on someone, the 'horror' begins to lose impact, reducing its effects to Stun 10 and no Willpower loss. If this genjutsu is broken (by the target being wounded, or somebody else using Kai on them) the Stun will end prematurely, but the lost Willpower will not be regained. If used on a target with 0 Willpower remaining, this technique's Stun is doubled (to 40, or 20, depending on whether or not it's been used on them previously in that battle).

### **Magen: Jigoku Kouka no Jutsu \- Demonic Illusion: Descending Hell Technique**

This illusion causes any afflicted by it to see a massive fireball forming above them which slowly descends. Most prudent shinobi will waste time trying to escape its radius, while those who are more reckless will take the 'attack' head-on, bracing themselves against a blow that never actually comes.

Chakra: 15  
Range: 25  
Area: 15  
Speed: 8  
Seal Speed: 10

Effects:  
If someone was affected by the genjutsu, they have until 25 IC have passed to leave this technique's area. If they don't, they suffer a Stun 15\. This genjutsu ended before the time is up will prevent the stun; once they are stunned, the illusion is already over and so cannot be 'broken' to end the stun prematurely.

This is treated as a targeted genjutsu, and is applied as a normally single-target genjutsu, compatible with Illusion Multi-Targeting as normal for that ability; despite its listed Area for escape reasons, it is a hallucinatory fireball, not an illusory one, and so it only exists in the minds of those specifically targeted by the genjutsu, with each person affected getting their own Area centered on them to escape from or choose not to.

### **Shinkirou no Jutsu \- Mirage Technique**

This creates an illusion that can fool a person's sight, hearing, or smell--or, with more effort, two of those, or all three. These can be dynamic (such as a flickering fire or a fluttering curtain), but they can't actually interact with anything.

Chakra: 10  
Upkeep: 3  
Range: 20  
Area: 2 (max)  
Speed: 10  
Seal Speed: 8

Effects:  
By default, this creates an illusion that only applies to one sense; examples would be an illusion of a curtain flapping in a breeze, or the sound of footsteps.  
By raising the chakra cost by 5, the illusion can apply to two senses, such as a tiger that crouches and snarls. Raising the chakra cost by 10 (to a total of 20\) allows the illusion to be convincing to all three, such as a fire that flickers, crackles, and smells like burning wood.  
This technique's primary limitation is its scale. It can't do anything much larger than a large piece of furniture or more complicated than one person. Anyone who interacts with this is allowed an Awareness roll against your Chakra Control to realize it's a fake, with your roll receiving a \+5 bonus.  
Some things can make this obviously fake, such as touching it or standing at the 'source' of the noise and realizing there's nothing there. You can control this illusion if you're in range; if not, you can set it to be essentially a looping recording.

## **C-rank**

### **Nemuri \- Sleep**

A genjutsu whose greatest limitation is that it requires physical contact, the user places their hand on a target and sends them immediately into a deep slumber. Very nice for infiltration without raising a fuss.

Chakra: 18  
Range: Touch  
Speed: 15  
Special: No handseals required.

Effects:  
This can't be used in combat. If you're able to touch the target and succeed with a genjutsu roll, they immediately fall asleep (it's a good idea to ease them to the ground, to avoid them, say, bashing their shoulder on a rock and immediately waking themselves back up).  
Unless they're woken up (see the Sleep status for details), they'll be asleep for at least four hours.

 

### **Kori Shinchuu no Jutsu \- Sly Mind Affect Technique**

This technique warps an opponent's senses and sets them walking in circles, potentially for hours on end, by making it seem to them as if they're walking straight towards their desired destination. Maps, compasses, and paths will all be ineffective--the best someone suffering from this technique can do is hold the hand of someone who's not, or hope they realize that they've passed the same landmark ten times.

Chakra: 18  
Range: 40  
Speed: 12  
Seal Speed: 14

Effects:  
This technique has no effect in combat, and does not end when the victim is wounded. You may target multiple people with this technique, costing 1 Willpower per additional person who is affected (this extra cost isn't paid if they defend against it).  
Someone affected by this technique will find themselves continually walking in circles if they try to travel any appreciable distance (half a mile or more). This lasts for 1 hour per point you beat their genjutsu roll by. Every hour, they're allowed a new genjutsu roll against your original result, to see if they notice the effects (although this will not break the technique on its own).  
Not even something like following a road will work--they'll wind up wandering off it, the illusion convincing them they're still on the "road."

### **Magen: Kokoni Arazu no Jutsu \- Demon Illusion: False Surroundings Technique**

This jutsu allows the user to change the surroundings around a person subtley, usually used to delay, or force people to walk in circles, unaware that they have stopped going the right way, even messing with ones ability to track the direction they are headed, such as north from south.

Chakra: 17  
Upkeep: 4  
Area: 30  
Speed: 10  
Seal Speed: 15

Effects:  
Best used out of combat (anyone who sees this being used will realize it's an illusion), this casts an illusion over an area. This could be making a door appear to be a solid wall, a sign have the wrong number on it, or an intact bridge appear to be broken.  
When used, make a genjutsu roll with a \+5 bonus. Anyone who encounters your illusion makes a genjutsu roll; failure means they believe it's real, success means they know it's an illusion. Actually getting rid of it requires the use of Genjustu Kai, though the illusion won't affect senses other than sight.

### **Shunou Kaimetsu \- Brain Destruction**

This jutsu convinces the victim that they've been grievously injured. Although it causes no actual physical harm, it convinces their mind and all their senses that they've suffered some manner of severe damage.

Chakra: 18  
Range: 30  
Speed: 14  
Seal Speed: 12

Effects:  
This inflicts a temporary wound on the victim. It's by default Minor, raised to Major if you beat their genjutsu roll by 5 or more, and Severe if you beat their roll by 10 or more. They interpret this technique as whatever sort of attack or jutsu would be appropriate to cause the injury they believe they're suffering from.  
They suffer all normal effects of this injury (and good luck trying to convince them it's all in their head), aside from HP loss or unconsciousness. It lasts until the genjutsu is broken.  
You choose the damage type and wound location.  
If the target has the ability to instantly heal the wound (e.g. Kaguya's Skeletal Realignment bone modification) or block it from ever manifesting in the first place (e.g. Henzaki's Organ Mobility), they can do this normally. This does not reveal to them that it is a fake wound and still costs the same costs as normal. Medical jutsu that temporarily heal a wound would do the same, but could be dispelled once it is realized it's not a true wound.  
Additionally, while any stamina penalties (e.g. Minor Blunt Abdomen wound Winded) and failed fatigue levels (e.g. any wound that causes Suffocation, in the event that the victim fails one of the Stamina checks caused by Suffocation) caused by the wound remain, any instant fatigue (e.g. Severe Piercing Abdomen wound Cavitation) from wounds would disappear when this jutsu ends. This means their fatigue level would be reduced by the amount it had been increased by due to the wound when this jutsu ends; the Stamina and Chakra Exhaustion penalties that were purged by advancing a fatigue level do not return, but any acquired since then remain. Finally, wounds caused by Brain Destruction cannot knock the victim unconscious, whether due to fatigue or as a result of the specific wound. The target can go over their normal fatigue level limit in this manner if it is necessary to maintain consciousness, following the normal bonuses and penalties caused by fatigue levels, only falling unconscious when their *real* fatigue level without the Brain Destruction wound is sufficient to do so. This inability to knock the victim unconscious does not inherently allow the target to realize they are under a genjutsu.  
As per normal wounds, Brain Destruction wounds break all genjutsu on the victim as per normal, save for itself, though it will break other instances of Brain Destruction, should multiple be applied.

Anyone who falls under this genjutsu discovers they are under this genjutsu X \* 3 IC after they fall under it, with X being the amount they failed their Genjutsu defense roll by.

### **Sen'un no Jutsu \- Fog of War Technique**

You trap a target in some manner of in-depth hallucination.  
They may believe that you've run away and think they're giving pursuit, or be convinced that they're locked in combat with you. This technique is often a last-ditch resort to escape from a superior adversary, or bypass someone when there's no time to deal with them in direct combat.

Chakra: 25 \+ X \* 3  
Range: 50  
Upkeep: 15  
Speed: 25  
Seal Speed: 20

Effects:  
Using this technique costs 1 Willpower if it succeeds. It has a \+X bonus to your Genjutsu roll, up to a maximum of \+5. If used successfully, whoever its victim was is left trapped in some manner of hallucination.  
The target is essentially removed from combat for this technique's duration. Unfortunately, this technique is particularly fragile. If the target senses danger (such as from an incoming jutsu, or planting explosives around them) it'll break in time for them to try to avoid it. It lasts for a maximum of 5 minutes per 1 point you beat their genjutsu roll by.

## **B-rank**

### **Nemurihane \- Sleep Feather**

An advanced version of Nemuri, this causes the subject to briefly see illusory feathers drifting down around them before they succumb to sleep. It's no more useful in combat, but it can actually be used at a range, or from hiding.

Chakra: 24  
Range: 25  
Speed: 15  
Seal Speed: 20

Effects:  
This functions as the C-rank Nemuri, but may be  
used at up to the listed range.

### **Magen: Nijuu Kokoni Arazu no Jutsu \- Demonic Illusion: Double False Surroundings Technique**

An advanced technique, this constructs one illusion on top of another. When the outer layer is destroyed, the second will flawlessly take its place and masquerade as reality. Confident that they've overcome the deception, most shinobi will have an even harder time realizing that they haven't done so at all.

Chakra: 25  
Upkeep: 8 (4 after the first layer is removed)  
Area: 30  
Speed: 16  
Seal Speed: 18  
Requires: False Surroundings Technique

Effects:  
As the regular False Surroundings technique, but removing the second illusion requires a second application of Genjutsu Kai, and your genjutsu roll with it has a \+10 bonus.  
This may also be used with Sly Mind Affect, by increasing this technique's cost by 6 and removing its Upkeep, in which case the second 'layer' of the technique has no bonus, but must still be 'discovered' after hours of wandering, as per the normal Sly Mind Affect genjutsu. Used this way, it becomes a targeted (rather than Area) technique), using Sly Mind Affect's normal range.

### **Magen: Jubaku Satsu \- Demon Illusion: Tree Binding Death**

This genjutsu makes its unfortunate victim believe that a large tree has suddenly grown behind them through the use of some manner of ninjutsu, and pinned them against its trunk by exceptionally-strong, chakra-animated branches.

Chakra: 34  
Range: 20  
Special: Immobilize 10  
Speed: 22  
Seal Speed: 16

Effects:  
Every 20 IC which pass, the victim is allowed another genjutsu defensive against your original roll, at a cumulative \+1 penalty, to realize that this is only an illusion.  
Effects which allow someone to reduce immobilization penalties do not apply against this technique.

Anyone who falls under this genjutsu discovers they are under this genjutsu X \* 1.5 (Rounded down) IC after they fall under it, with X being the amount they failed their Genjutsu defense roll by.

### **Jigyaku no Jutsu \- Time Reversal Technique**

Used on willing or restrained recipients, this jutsu puts the target in a trance like state, and keeps them hypnotized, to uncover forgotten memories or past events. Its often used to uncover important details that have been missed or forgotten on missions, or to help shinobi make 100% accurate reports on the most important of missions, rarely on unimportant missions.

Chakra: 28  
Range: Touch  
Speed: 20  
Seal Speed: 25

Effects:  
This can only be used on helpless or willing recipients. It places the subject into a trance-like state, similar to hypnosis. It causes them to recall any suppressed memories, and can help remember details they might otherwise have forgotten.  
Mechanically, this will unravel the effects of the A-rank Sennou Sousa no Jutsu, and gives a \+5 bonus to Research rolls made to remember details about a previous experience (such as glancing around a room and needing to recall its contents). It will also uncover any memories suppressed due to trauma or similar causes.  
This can take anywhere from a few minutes to several hours, depending on what it's being used for, how deeply buried the hidden memories are, and how much information needs to be remembered. This technique may only be used on a given person once per day.

### **Gosaru Tatari \- Five Monkey Curse**

This technique interferes with the victim's ability to see, hear, smell, taste, and feel pain. Admittedly, the last one's an undesirable addition to the mix (in most circumstances), butthe technique makes up for that with its all-around usefulness.

Chakra: 18  
Range: 30  
Speed: 14  
Seal Speed: 15

Effects:  
This negates all ranks the victim has in Enhanced Hearing and Enhanced Sight, and any abilities dependent upon them (such as Blind Fighting or Genjutsu Awareness).  
They also suffer a \-2 visibility penalty (which stacks with any other visibility penalties they may have). On the other hand, their reduced sensory perception allows them to ignore the penalties of any Minor wounds they may be suffering from.

Anyone who falls under this genjutsu discovers they are under this genjutsu X \* 3 IC after they fall under it, with X being the amount they failed their Genjutsu defense roll by.

### **Magen: Tetsuotome no Jutsu \- Demonic Illusion: Iron Maiden Technique**

Chains burst from the ground beneath the victim and wrap around their legs, anchoring them in place, followed by two halves of an iron maiden, either on each side of the victim or in front of and behind them. The iron maiden slams shut with them in it, causing excruciating pain and a slew of debilitating injuries.

Chakra: 30  
Range: 30  
Special: Stun 12  
Speed: 12  
Seal Speed: 18

Effects:  
This temporarily inflicts a Minor Piercing wound on every location of the opponent's body (torso, abdomen, both arms, both legs, and Slashing on the head). If the genjutsu roll beats their defense by 10 points or more, this is upgraded to a Major Piercing wound on every location. These wounds last for the duration of the illusion, though the full Stun will remain even if it's broken early.

Anyone who falls under this genjutsu discovers they are under this genjutsu X \* 3 IC after they fall under it, with X being the amount they failed their Genjutsu defense roll by.

### **Sakki \- Killing Intent**

A side-effect of learning how to control chakra is the ability to sense, and exude, what shinobi refer to as killing intent. More powerful shinobi can project it more strongly, and even send lesser ninja running with just a glance.  
This genjutsu simulates an intense blast of paralyzingly strong killing intent in an attempt to overwhelm its target.

Chakra: 30  
Range: 15  
Special: Stun 10 \+ X  
Speed: 10

Effects:  
You and your target must have line of sight with one another (and neither can be suffering from a visibility penalty of \-6 or greater). X is the amount the victim failed their Genjutsu dodge roll by, and until the stun has ended they suffer from Paralysis X/3. The stun is cut short if the jutsu ends early.  
This technique doesn't require handseals.

Anyone who falls under this genjutsu discovers they are under this genjutsu X \* 3 IC after they fall under it, with X being the amount they failed their Genjutsu defense roll by.

## **A-rank**

### **Nehan Shouja no Jutsu \- Temple of Nirvana Technique**

The most powerful version of Nemuri, used for putting a large group of people to sleep. Anybody within fifty meters of the user who fails their Genjutsu dodge is put into a deep sleep. Nothing short of extremely loud noises, being shaken awake, several hours passing, or similar situations will wake them up, allowing victims to be bound, moved, or completely ignored. This move is again, useless in combat.

Chakra: 30  
Range: 150  
Area: 50  
Speed: 20  
Seal Speed: 30

Effects:  
Anyone in the area who fails a genjutsu dodge falls asleep. Anyone with less than half the user's total XP automatically fails their genjutsu dodge unless they spend a point of Willpower to be allowed to actually roll it (that roll does not gain the normal effects of benefitting from Willpower being spent on it, unless they spend another point).  
And, once again, it's no good on targets who are engaged in combat. Like Nemuri, victims will be asleep for several hours unless awoken.

### **Kokuangyo no Jutsu \- Bringer of-Darkness Technique**

This technique specifically targets the victim's eyesight, effectively blinding them and allowing its user to attack with impunity.

Chakra: 36  
Range: 50  
Speed: 20  
Seal Speed: 26

Effects:  
This applies a \-10 visibility penalty to the victim.  
While it's in effect, anyone can attempt to hide from them (even if the victim can somehow reduce that penalty below \-6).  
This technique does not automatically end when the victim is wounded. Instead, it requires a successful use of Genjutsu Kai (with a \-10 penalty) or a Major or greater wound to be inflicted upon the technique's user.  
While in effect, this technique essentially negates any doujutsu the victim may possess.

### **Kiokure Keiren \- Nervous Convulsions**

This technique partially hijacks the victim's nervous system, reacting in response to anything they do and sending conflicting signals. It's only truly effective in combat, where physical activity is the most spontaneous, and even slightly reduced reaction time can prove fatal. This tends to be exceptionally painful.

Chakra: 35  
Range: 40  
Speed: 14  
Seal Speed: 27

Effects:  
Whenever you take an Action while under this technique's effects, X is that action's Speed. You suffer from a Paralyze (X)/2, which lasts for (X)\*2 IC, applied after your Action is resolved.  
Every time this effect is activated, you roll another genjutsu defense against the original result. Once you succeed, and are free from the genjutsu, new Paralyze statuses stop triggering, but any existing ones will remain for their full duration.

### **Sennou Sousa no Jutsu \- Memory-Concealing Manipulative Sand Technique**

This technique allows the user to alter or conceal the subject's memories. While it's not permanent, the change can be either subtle (believing they were incapacitated and left unconscious, rather than incapacitated and then interrogated), or about as much so as a sledgehammer (erasing the past two days of their memory).

Chakra: 30  
Range: Touch  
Speed: 30  
Seal Speed: 30

Effects:  
This may only be used on a helpless or willing subject.  
On a willing recipient, the technique is incredibly potent. It can suppress virtually any amount of a person's memories, and can even be used to alter existing memories or create wholly fabricated ones. One popular way of using the technique is to implant false memories of a person choosing to defect (and suppressing ones of them coming up with this plan) and then using them as a double-agent, working alongside and gathering intel from the enemy until the technique is undone at the right moment for them to change back to their original allegiance. Indeed, this jutsu is one of the more pragmatic reasons for most villages not trusting missing nin defectors.  
On a helpless and unwilling target, the jutsu's efficacy is greatly reduced. An opposed genjutsu roll is made, and "X" is determined as the amount this technique's user succeeded by.  
Up to X hours worth of memories, in the past X days, can be erased. The greatest limitation is the user's knowledge. "Your meeting with the daimyo" could be targeted for erasure, but there's no way of knowing if the target also received secret orders after that meeting. "Finding us here", and "the past few hours" are reasonably common uses.  
No matter how extreme this technique is, it can't alter one's subconscious. You cannot forget abilities, jutsu, or your name.  
You might forget a person you met, but they'd always be slightly familiar.  
Although a person could be afflicted with multiple instances of this genjutsu, it can only be applied once per week. Genjutsu kai will not remove this technique, nor will being wounded. When you apply this technique, make a genjutsu roll. Anyone other than you attempting to unravel it (such as with the B-rank Jigyaku no Jutsu) has to roll at least that high when they attempt to do so, or they won't even notice this technique's presence.

### **Dokushin no Jutsu \- Poison Truth Technique**

This technique traps the victim in a state of dream-like hallucination. In that state, the technique's user can try to pry information from them, in the form of questions, which the subject will then (coherently, and audibly) mumble the answer to.  
Unlike torture, this technique leaves no physical marks, and the victims will not remember what information they revealed or managed to kept secret. It often takes longer than torture to extract usable information, but it's much more reliable because the subject can't lie.  
Multiple, especially consecutive, uses of this technique can leave a victim traumatized without knowing why--indeed, even the users aren't entirely sure what kind of hallucinations the victim experiences. While it's not quite a forbidden technique, using it is considered extremely morally ambiguous.

Chakra: 30  
Range: Touch  
Speed: 20  
Seal Speed: 50

Effects:  
This technique may only be used on a helpless victim, and when used immediately puts them to sleep. The genjutsu user must then focus for the victim's maximum Willpower in hours.  
The interrogator asks a question up to twelve words long, and an opposed genjutsu roll is made.  
If the interrogator succeeds, the subject must answer the question truthfully and without obfuscation. (To the question, 'Where is the scroll?', "In the castle" would not be a legitimate answer, but "In my room in the castle" would). The subject only has to answer the question asked, not the question intended.  
If the interrogator fails, the subject does not have to answer that question. Alternately, they may spend a point of Willpower and automatically succeed against a given question.  
Each time a question is asked, the subject gets a \+2 bonus on future genjutsu rolls against this technique, unless they spent a point of Willpower to automatically avoid answering.  
So long as this bonus lasts, the following questions cannot be asked: \> Any question that they've previously been asked during that session. \> A rewording of a previous question ("Who was that person?" instead of "Who was that man?", for example)  
If the victim does not know the answer to a question, that question is simply wasted. The cumulative bonus to defend against this technique lasts for the victim's maximum Willpower in days. A person won't begin to regain Willpower (spent defending against this technique, or for any other reason) until at least 24 hours have passed without Dokushin no Jutsu being used upon them.
