### **Roleplay**

Roleplay is interacting with others while playing as your character. Do note that this does have to be with other people; playing with yourself may be fun, but claiming you should be rewarded for it is just silly. People who are in a spar or fight are not considered to be interactable for the purpose of claiming xp.

Every half hour of in-character activity awards 2 XP. You must remain reasonably active throughout this. Thus, if you were playing for an hour and a half, but had to take a twenty minute break in the middle for whatever reason, you would get 4 XP, counting only the hour and ten minutes during which you were actually RPing.

When in doubt, use common sense.

### **Combat**

As highly-trained (well, in theory), supernaturally-powered fighters, ninja can learn a lot from combat, testing their abilities against one another. Most of the time this is (semi-)friendly practice rounds, or spars. Sometimes it's, well... not.

You get 2 XP for every 30 minutes the fight lasts, though you do not accumulate RP XP during that time. Additionally, you may receive bonus XP for your fight depending on how things went. Consult the lists below\!

Bonuses: \+1 per Fatigue level you end the battle at, to a maximum of \+5 \+2 for every Major wound you acquire \+4 for every Severe wound you acquire \+6 for every Critical wound you acquire.

Penalties: \-2 per Fatigue level you begin the battle and \-1 per Wound (regardless of level) you start the battle with.

After fighting someone, you may not gain XP for fighting that person for 24 hours. If you, however, are in a spar with them and other people (who you haven't fought in the past 24 hours) you will still gain XP for it. Additionally, any wounds that are denied/healed(such as through henzaki's organ mobility or kaguya's skeletal reallignment) during the fight do not grant bonus XP. This also applies to genjutsu wounds as they are not real, and do not grant XP. Any fatigue levels you recover through means other than standard rest, retroactively lose their EXP bonus(such as from soldier pill.)

### **Events**

Although the game revolves around the PCs, the world they're in does not. Things are constantly going on off-screen, separate from casual role playing. Sometimes, GMs will make this known through an event.

These are often missions which the characters are sent on by their village, with clearly defined objectives such as delivering an item or protecting a person. However, this is by no means the only type of event.

You do not get XP for RPing during events, nor do you get XP for any combat which takes place as part of one. Instead, the GM who ran the event will tell you how much XP you have earned.

### **Other**

You may get XP in some other fashion. Usually, this will involve a GM telling you how much you got, and for what reason.

## **Spending Experience Points** {#spending-experience-points}

### **Attributes**

XP can be spent to increase any of your five basic attributes. Starting out, the cost to do this is 4 XP per 1 point in any single attribute.

The primary restriction on this is the poorly-named 'rule of 3'. What this means is: the amount you have increased an attribute may not be more than 3 points higher than the next highest amount you have increased an attribute by.

Because an example will make it clearer: You could raise your STR by 3 points (for 12 XP). To raise it to 4 points, a single other attribute would need to have been raised by at least 1, for a total of (4+1)\*4 \= 20 XP.

Say you had raised your STR and RES by 12 each, your CHA by 9, your AGI by 6, and your DEX by 3\. You could raise your STR or your RES to 15 right away, but to raise both of them to 13 you'd need to raise your DEX, AGI, and CHA by 1 each (in that order).

And, to be clear, only the amount you have raised an attribute by using XP matters; its starting value, or bonuses from uniques (or any other sources), is not part of this limit.

Aside from that restriction, raising attributes summons from a degree of diminishing returns. The first 50 points in an attribute cost, as stated, 4 XP; the next 50 cost 5 XP per \+1, the next 50 cost 6 XP per \+1, and so forth. Thus, to raise your STR by 62 points you would have to spend a total of (504 \+ 125\) \= 260 XP... not counting what you'd have to spend on other attributes to satisfy the 'rule of 3'.

Finally, you may spend no more than half your total XP on stats. So, if you had 1000 XP, you could spend no more 500 XP on raising your stat points.

### **Abilities**

The full details of spending XP to learn abilities are discussed in Chapter 4\. But, in brief: it varies from one ability to another, with the costs being listed in individual abilities.

### **Jutsu**

A ninja who intends to be successful would do well to have a wide variety of techniques at their disposal. The actual restrictions on what you can and can't learn are discussed in detail in Chapter 6\. Once you meet the requirements to acquire a jutsu you want, to learn (or 'purchase') it you spend an amount of XP determined by its rank, as listed... below:

E: 4  
D: 6  
C: 9  
B: 18  
A: 36

### **Other**

Anything else you can spend XP on will likely explain the rules for doing so in its description.

### **Experience Bonuses**

Clanless characters, and certain clans (which will say so in their description), get what is called an experience bonus. This is an amount beyond your Total XP which you can spend.

Experience Bonuses are given in percentages--for example, Clanless characters have a 10% XP Bonus. Take, for example, a clanless character who's earned 100 XP from RP, 100 from fighting, and 23 from events, on top of his starting 100 XP. This means that his Total XP is 323, just like any normal character.

However, he also has a 10% XP bonus; this means that his bonus XP is 32\. Thus, in his Spent XP log (you'll read more about logs later in this chapter) he would record XP Total as 323, "XP Bonus (%)" as 32 (and change the % to 10%), and "Total \+ Bonus" as (323+32) 355\.

Your total amount of XP spent can go up to your Total \+ Bonus.

However, your bonus is not actually part of your Total XP. Many things are based on your Total XP, such as bonuses to Genjutsu rolls, your Skill Points, and Talents. XP bonuses have no effect on these.
