# **Exploding Tags**

## **Exploding Tags**

Rectangular slips of paper inscribed with special seals, centered around the kanji for "explode". They're infused with chakra, but normally inert. A tag can be "primed" by focusing a small amount of chakra into them, at which point they can stick to most surfaces (like walls, or the underside of bridges; even unsuspecting people) and will detonate on their own after some time. 

Fire will not cause tags to explode, nor will they explode in a "chain reaction". A tag that is blown up or burnt, even a primed one, is just destroyed. Tags are destroyed if they receive any damage before exploding.

Tags do 5d10.open(5) damage, in Area 10\. If multiple tags are set off on the same IC (and someone is hit by them all), their damage is combined for determining what wounds they inflict; explosions inflict Blunt wounds.

When detonated, tags count as a Speed 8+2 per tags attack that cannot be made faster by any means for the purpose of valid interrupts. They cannot be dodged but any Ninjutsu defense automatically succeeds, they can also be Blocked by following Block’s normal rules. Blocking reduces damage by 50%. Anyone who escapes their area before they explode automatically avoids all damage.

There are many ways to Prime a Tag, as described below. Tags are tied to their primer, hence no one but the person using the Tag can use the Detonation options. The last application of any of the below options overrides any previous application.

### **Contact Detonation**

This means priming the Tag while you are holding it or touching it. 

Chakra: 5  
Speed: 10  
Prerequisites: Genin. All Genin are taught how to do this at the Academy.

Effect: You can set the Detonation time between 10 IC and (10+Chakra Control Ranks) IC. 

### **Remote Detonation**

This is the safe approach at Detonating Exploding Tags. By focusing the Chakra from a distance, you can Prime a tag from a few yards away.

Chakra: 10+3\*X  
Speed: 12  
Seal Speed: 4+2\*X  
Range CHA/10 yards  
Prerequisites: Chuunin, or 10 Ranks in Chakra Control

Effect: X is the number of Tags. You can set the Detonation time between  10 IC and (10+Chakra Control Ranks) IC. 

### **Instant Remote/Triggered:**

This is the most advanced form of Tag Detonation. You can instantly set off a Tag within your range or you can set up a condition for the detonation that is independent of the time elapsed.

Chakra: 10+Y  
Speed: 12  
Seal Speed: 6  
Range CHA/10 yards

Prerequisite: Jounin, or 20 Ranks in Chakra Control.

Effect: Y is distance to the Tag in yards. You can set the Detonation time between 0 IC and (10+Chakra Control Ranks) IC or On Trigger. The Trigger is a Distance between 0 and CHA/10 yards, whenever someone enters this radius, the Tag instantly detonates.

Other than placing a Tag by hand, there are two other ways to use them:

Attaching to a Weapon: As part of a ranged attack, multi-throw or jutsu that uses ranged weapons, you can add a Chakra 10 cost (or \+10 if it already had one), Seal Speed 6 (or \+6) and Speed \+5 to the attack in order to attach 1 Tag to the attack. Whether it hits or misses, the Tagged weapon always ends up at the position of the target. It will Detonate 15 IC after the attack resolves (unless a new Detonation application is used before it explodes).

Attaching after Failed defense: Against any type of Melee Attack that hits you, you can perform a Spd 1 Interrupt (after resolving the attack, but before advancing IC) to attach 1 Tag to your attacker (in the relevant part of their body or weapon). Anyone who has a Tag attached to them in this manner rolls the higher of Awareness or Survival vs the one who attached the Tag’s Espionage or Stealth whichever is higher, on a success, they realise the Tag is attached and immediately detach it, leaving it at the position that the attack took place. If this check fails, the attacker notices the Tag too late and it then requires a Spd 5 action to remove (removed Tags are dropped at the location they were removed, they cannot be thrown or reattached to something else). If a Tag explodes while still attached to someone, they cannot defend against it. Blocking does work against attached Tags, however.

Requires: Genin Rank

Cost: 10000 Ryo

## **Exploding Tag, Type 2**

A more powerful version of the regular exploding tags, not given to genin because experience has shown, time and again, that genin really can't be trusted with high-end explosives. Chuunin, however, are more responsible--at least, in theory.

Therefore, they get to play with the big explosions\! Type 2 tags function identically to regular exploding tags in most regards, though they deal 10d10.open(5) damage and have an Area of 20\. Additionally, they deal double damage to inanimate objects (such as walls, including jutsu based defenses).

Requires: Chuunin Rank

Cost: 25000 Ryo

## **Exploding Tag, Type 3**

The end-all and be-all of 'mundane' explosives, reserved for jounin simply because of how difficult they are to produce, which is in turn reflected in how troublesome they are to get ahold of.

Type 3, like Type 2, deal double damage to inanimate objects. They deal 20d10.open(5) damage, and have an Area of 30\.

Requires: Jounin Rank

Cost: 50000 Ryo
