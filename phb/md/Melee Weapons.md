# **Melee Weapons**

Melee Weapons will have one or more of the following Tags, these Tags determine the type of damage the item inflicts, how many hands are needed to use them, their size and any other special characteristics it may possess. Even if the Tag does not have any specific rules, it’s there because an Ability or a Jutsu might apply to weapons with such a Tag.

* Sword: Weapon Category.
* Polearm: Weapon Category.
* Club: Weapon Category
* Chain: Weapon Category
* Fan: Weapon Category
* Slashing, Piercing, Blunt: Damage Type Category. This determines what type of Wound the weapon inflicts. If a Weapon has more than one Damage Type, you must choose which one you are using when declaring an attack.
* Small: Size Category. Their Range is 0 yards.
* Medium: Size Category. Their Range is 1 yard.
* Large: Size Category. Their Range is 2 yards. 
* Extreme: Size Category. Their Range is 3 yards. Parrying with an Extreme Weapon has a \-3 Accuracy penalty and the Parry action’s Base Speed is increased to 4.
* One-Handed: The weapon can only be used by holding it in one hand.
* Two-Handed: The weapon can only be used by holding it with two hands. The weapon increases its user's Damage Bonus by 50%, this does not apply to the Damage Bonus provided by Weapon Focus or Ninjutsu techniques. These weapons require both hands at all times. You can not remove one hand to use items or other things that require an open hand. The Monkey Grip Ability, however, adds this option.
* Dual: Dual weapons are designed to be used in pairs.


# **Customizations**

Even though these weapons are generally mass produced, oftentimes a blacksmith will be lenient enough to provide slight variations or make small modifications to the basic items. Using the Crafting Rules you may upgrade a choice below up to an Artisan cost of 5. The price is then increased by 4k Ryo per Artisan Point spent.
