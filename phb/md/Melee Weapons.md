# **Melee Weapons**

Melee Weapons will have one or more of the following Tags, these Tags determine the type of damage the item inflicts, how many hands are needed to use them, their size and any other special characteristics it may possess. Even if the Tag does not have any specific rules, it’s there because an Ability or a Jutsu might apply to weapons with such a Tag.

* Sword: Weapon Category.  
* Polearm: Weapon Category.  
* Slashing, Piercing, Blunt: Damage Type Category. This determines what type of Wound the weapon inflicts. If a Weapon has more than one Damage Type, you must choose which one you are using when declaring an attack.  
* Small: Size Category. Their Range is 0 yards.  
* Medium: Size Category. Their Range is 1 yard. Medium weapons have a \+2 Accuracy bonus when parrying other Medium Weapons.  
* Large: Size Category. Their Range is 2 yards.   
* Extreme: Size Category. Their Range is 3 yards. Parrying with an Extreme Weapon has a \-3 Accuracy penalty and the Parry action’s Base Speed is increased to 4\.  
* One-Handed: The weapon can only be used by holding it in one hand.  
* Two-Handed: The weapon can only be used by holding it with two hands. The weapon increases its user's Damage Bonus by 50%, this does not apply to the Damage Bonus provided by Weapon Focus or Ninjutsu techniques. These weapons require both hands at all times. You can not remove one hand to use items or other things that require an open hand. The Monkey Grip Ability, however, adds this option.  
* Fan: This weapon can be used to supplement Fuuton Ninjutsu by removing its Seal Speed requirement.  
* Dual: Dual weapons are designed to be used in pairs. Their cost includes 2 of the items.  
* Chain: Chain weapons are designed to reach further than normal weapons. Their Range is \+5 yards.

### **Nodachi \[Slashing, Large, One-Handed, Two-Handed\]**

The largest practical weapon, the nodachi is designed for use as a two-handed weapon. Ninja, however, have the brute strength necessary to use them one-handed, its size gives it enough momentum to bypass most defenses, but also makes it slower to reposition for defense.

All polearms ignore the target’s Touch-based and On-Hit effects.

### **Bo Staff \[Blunt, Large, Two-Handed\]**

### **Tonfa \[Blunt, Medium, One-Handed, Dual\]**

Originating from a small island off the shore of fire country, the tonfa began as a martial arts implement, which ninja have seen fit to 'borrow' and upgrade. A single tonfa is essentially a circular wooden bar the length of the wielder's forearm with a handle 1/4 of the way from one end. Typically wielded in pairs, they're an unorthodox but sometimes-effective weapon.

### **Gunbai \[Blunt, Large, Two-Handed, Fan\]**

Large fans with reinforced wooden slats, these were originally used by generals to signal soldiers on battlefields. Then some ninja was looking for a way to be unique, got a hold of the idea, and, well... the usual. Though they're several feet long, these fans do (impressively) fold.
