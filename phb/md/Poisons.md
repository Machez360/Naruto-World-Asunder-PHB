# **Poisons**

Poisons are nasty business, and one of the murkier aspects of ninja tactics. Certainly, before the days when shinobi had discovered the secrets of chakra manipulation, poisons were a vital part of their arsenal. The proper use of poisons, however, is hard to learn, and in most circumstances just isn't as useful as being able to shoot fireballs and run up walls.

Some ninja, however, still find uses for them. This section is for them\!

## **Rules**

### **Brewing**

Getting your hands on some Poison isn’t an easy thing, those who have mastered its use understandably don’t advertise that or their inventory of deadly chemicals. And you aren’t going to find some on the open market either. Which means that you’ll have to gather the ingredients and make it yourself.

But that imposes its own complications, most techniques for cultivating deadly venoms are tightly held secrets, and figuring out the best ratios and ingredients is an arduous if not expensive process. To even begin, you’ll need to acquire the appropriate talent, which typically means you’ll have to find one of those previously mentioned masters and convince them to not use their tools of death on you and instead teach you how to use them on your enemies. Once you do, you can begin with the process detailed below.

### **Poison Points and TN**

As mentioned before, making poisons is difficult, even if you have all of the ingredients and an inexhaustible amount of money. There is only so much an amateur can do before they end up just making a useless mush of foul smelling liquids. You have (Toxicology/5) Poison Points, no specific Poison you make can have more than this many Poison Points worth of effects.

Furthermore, Poisons tend to take a while to make. As your skills progress, you’ll figure out better techniques to distill the ingredients and brew your venoms, but the more complex a Poison you make, the more time it’ll take to finish brewing it. Brewing Poisons requires a Poison TN, a Target Number you must reach using Toxicology rolls during Downtime Actions. The Poison TN is determined by the individual effects that the Poison has. All effects have a base increase to Poison TN, and a scaling increase should the effect be taken again. For example, Severity has a base increase to Poison TN of 3, and a scale of 2\. Meaning the first time it is taken, it increase the base Poison TN of 10 to 13, but if Severity were taken again for the same Poison, it gains an extra 5 (Base 3+2) to TN, becoming a Poison TN of 18, if Severity was taken a third time, the TN increase is 7 (5+2) making the final Poison TN a 25\. 

Toxicology rolls carry over to the next Downtime until you’ve reached the TN, however, any extra points leftover after that are completely gone.

### **Doses and Costs**

Poisons are measured in doses. A dose is how much of the substance is required to poison a ninja and apply the effects of a particular brew. Whenever you Brew a new Poison, this is how much you make. Once, the main measurement unit was how many whales or elephants the poison could kill (The bare minimum needed to even begin affecting ninja) but we’ve long since moved past such archaic measurements.

Every additional effect of a dose of Poison has a cost in Ryo, this represents the costs of ingredients and reagents and tools that are needed to be acquired to Brew that specific batch. If the total Ryo cost cannot be met, then the Brewer simply doesn’t have enough ingredients to make that Poison.

### **Types of Poison**

Poisons have four possible vectors, or ways to inflict them upon the unfortunate souls fighting you: Contact, Injury, Inhalation, and Ingestion. When you start making a Poison, you must apply which vector is used to apply your Poison with. There are pros and cons to each form of Poison, and the skilled brewer knows that there is a right situation for every kind.

Contact: Contact Poisons can be applied to any blunt or slashing weapon, and as long as you hit with the Contact Poison, even if you deal no damage, you apply a dose of the Poison. Contact Poisons gain no other effects.

Injury: Injury Poisons can be applied to any Piercing or Slashing weapon, but require the attack to deal a Minor Wound at the minimum to apply a dose of their effects. Doses of Injury Poisons won’t be used up until a Wound is applied. Injury Poisons are quite versatile and deadly, they gain an extra 3 Poison Points worth of effects.

Ingestion: Ingestion Poisons are effectively useless in combat, but can be used to lace someone's food or somehow trick a person into eating it. When chosen, the Brewer can choose whether the effects apply immediately once eaten, or up to \[Toxicology/5\] hours from the time of ingestion, to a max of 8 hours. All effects of Ingestion poisons are doubled due to their lethality.

Inhalation: Inhalation Poisons typically require esoteric methods to apply them, the most common of which is the Poison Smoke Bomb. But they are also frequently used as parts of traps and such. Inhalation Poisons are hard to avoid, so long as somebody is within the Poison’s area, they automatically receive. But this gaseous nature means the Poison is more distilled, Inhalation Poisons have 2 Poison Points less than normal.

No matter how many poisons you're afflicted by, or their type, similar effects do not stack. Thus, if you had an Injury Poison that gave Poison Severity 4 and Immobilization 2 for Duration 50, and an Inhalation Poison that gave Poison Severity 2 and Immobilization 1 for Duration 75, you would take 4 damage per initiative count and have Immob 2 for 50 IC, and then for the next 25 you'd take 2 damage per IC and have Immob 1\. Any additional effects apply regardless, as long as they don't overlap (Paralysis 1 and Paralysis 3 is just Paralysis 3, as normal).

### **Time**

When Shinobi are in a fight, their hearts are beating a mile a minute (sometimes it literally is that fast), and their circulatory system is in full gear. While this tends to sharpen their reflexes and prepare their bodies for the fight, it also makes Poisons spread all that much faster through their system. During a fight or similarly high-stress scenarios, Duration of Poisons are measured in ICs, meaning its effects are applied every IC, including the Poison’s Severity. However, outside of combat, or when the Ninja is incapacitated, the heart slows down and the body has more resources to invest into battling the Poison, Duration during these times are measured in minutes rather than ICs. For example, a Poison Severity 5, Duration 75 applied outside of combat lasts for 75 minutes, and every minute they would lose 5 Vitality or HP.

### **Resisting Poison**

Whenever you’re hit by a weapon with Contact poison, or damaged by one with Injury poison, you roll Resistance against the poison user’s Toxicology. If you fail this roll (which does receive the benefits or partial defense), you have been poisoned. You’re afflicted by the poison’s status effects (Poison of some value, and sometimes other effects, described in the individual poison) for its Duration. If partial defense applies, it reduces the Duration, not the severity.

### **Applying to Weapons**

One dose of poison is enough to coat the business end of a weapon.

As a Speed 10 action you can apply up to 1 \+ Toxicology/10 doses worth of poisons to your weapons, in any combination. For instance, if you applied 4 doses, you could poison:

* 1 weapon with 4 doses  
* 4 weapons with 1 dose each  
* 1 weapon with 2 doses and 2 more weapons with 1 dose each  
* etc

Each time the weapon hits something, it loses one dose, the order in which it applies doses should be declared on poison application (i.e. First layer Yew, Second layer Centipede, Etc). If you apply a new poison or poisons to the weapon, any remaining poison is wiped away.

Due to the care it takes to not poison yourself when throwing Shurikens and Kunai, coated ranged weapons cannot be used in multi-throws.

### **Resisting and Identifying Poisons**

Overcoming Poisons isn’t simple, they’re kind of made to be deadly, but Ninja are known for being able to do the impossible. Having a supercharged immune system is the least of their talents. Whenever you have a Dose of Poison applied to you, you must roll Resistance against the Toxicology TN of the original creator.

When you or someone else has been poisoned, it's possible to identify the venom just based on the symptoms. you can roll a Toxicology, or Medicine skill check (your preference) against the Poison’s Toxicology TN \-5. Success means you've identified the Poison and know its effects and can begin working on an Antidote so long as you have the proper Toolkit. Failure means, obviously, you do not. You cannot repeat this roll.
